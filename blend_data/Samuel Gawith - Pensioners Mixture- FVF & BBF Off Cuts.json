        "notes": "Notes:Every time Samuel Gawith produce on their large cakes (plugs), they have to cut off the rough edges. Rather than wasting these \u201coff cuts\u201d, they store them up and sell out as a \u201cPensioners Mixture\u201d. This tobacco is not as refined as the usual tobaccos from the Iconic Kendal factory, but offer a high quality smoke for less money than the cheap shags made for supermarkets. In this case, Full Virginia Flake and Best Brown Flake are the tobacco off cuts mixed together.\n\nAs of now, it's not a commercial release and is only available at a couple of on-line vendors, GQ Tobaccos being one of them.",
