        "notes": "Notes:The portfolio on their website says the following (translated from German): \"Rauch pipe tobacco is 100% natural tobacco, without additives, 100% grown and processed in Austria. The Rauch family values down-to-earthness in all aspects of living. Besides taking care of their vineyards in Styria rich of volcanic soil, closely in touch with nature, getting back to the basic traditional values like family, diligence and people working together is part of this life. In this spirit the Rauch family continues the tradition of tobacco farming that Alois Rauch had committed himself to until 1980. Affectionately, they farm tobacco themselves creating the foundation for the pure delight of 100% Austrian natural tobacco. Rauch Pfeifentabak has a pleasant note of wild honey, licorice and hay flowers and develops a smooth, mildly spicy smoke.\"\n\nThe owner claims that he revived his grandfather's tobacco farm in Styria that ceased production in 1980. Johannes Rauch also produces the 'Ostarrichi' brand cigar, made of Austrian-grown tobacco.",
