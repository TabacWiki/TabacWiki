        "description": "We created Carolina Red Flake as a tribute to the Old Belt, to the traditional harvesting and processing of Carolina tobacco straight from Carolina soil. Building on that tradition, Carolina Red Flake with Perique elevates equal measures of stoved and unstoved, single-farm, North Carolina red-orange Virginia tips from 2020 with a generous portion of genuine St. James perique. The resulting flavor balances pepper and spice with undertones of port wine, stone fruits, and citrus. It's rich, deep, and complex. It's how a Virginia/Perique flake should be.",
        "notes": "Notes:Carolina Red Flake with Perique represents head blender Jeremy Reeves' ideal impression of a Virginia/Perique blend. C&D's latest run combines equal parts stoved and unstoved, top-tier red-orange Virginia tips from a single farm in North Carolina, forming a naturally sweet, bready, and tangy foundation with deeper, more baritone notes that pair exceptionally well with its genuine St. James perique \u2014 grown, harvested, processed, and barrel-aged on a single farm in the heart of St. James Parish, Louisiana.\n\nLayered with satisfying complexity, Carolina Red Flake with Perique offers an enticing melody of flavors and aromas, balancing pepper and piquancy with undertones of port wine and stone fruits alongside brighter citrusy highlights. The stoving process, together with the St. James perique, lends an unparalleled richness and nuance to the mixture, complementing the unstoved leaf's brighter notes with figgy sweetness, breadiness, and earthy spice. While incredibly complex right out of the tin, it's a blend that will no doubt increase in complexity and continue to improve with age.",
