        "description": "Together with Thomas Nitsche from Kopp Tobaccos, Cigarworld have come up with something special. A beautiful curly cut, consisting of various Virginia varieties, Burley and very little Kentucky, was enriched with a good 10% Perique. The result is a blend that shouts \u2018Hello Perique\u2019 when you open it!\n\nIt is certainly not a tobacco for those who like to smoke mild, sweet, harmonious blends. Rather the opposite. Cigarworld is sure that Three Monks will polarise.\n\nThe Three Monks has a lot of flavour, but is not overpowering. \n\nIt has intense black bread flavours, which are wonderfully supported by the pepper and sourdough aroma of the Perique.\n\nDespite the cut, it burns wonderfully. However, it should be allowed to dry, as it is relatively moist when fresh from the tin.",
