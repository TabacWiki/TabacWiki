        "description": "This is a truly beautiful mixture to look at: A wide range of colors (from very bright to jet black) and cuts (including rubbed out flakes and Black Cavendish). The pouch aroma tells you that this is not a lightly flavored mixture; it smells of fruit and molasses. It's very easy to pack and light, and it burns very regularly and effortlessly. The taste is very pleasant, with a combination of sweet and sour, but it is the former that is dominant. The room aroma is very, very pleasant, with a touch of nuttiness and fruitiness. Due to the wild cut, it is an ideal tobacco to smoke on a windy day outdoors. What is impressive is how consistent the taste and aroma are till the very bottom of the bowl! If you like Rubino, you're bound to enjoy this one.",
