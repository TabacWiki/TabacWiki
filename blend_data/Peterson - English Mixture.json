        "description": "Proudly and based on the long tradition of the Peterson family of brands, STG presents an exclusive blend of matured Virginia tobacco, a touch of Perique and a little Black Cavendish.\n\nThis tobacco gets its special note thanks to more than 3 years of storage in oak barrels, where its taste comes to full, opulent bloom.\n\nThe effect of oak barrel maturation with the addition of the whiskey is nothing less than astonishing. The aromas of the tobacco, the wood and the whiskey not only merge - they also highlight the finest nuances of the tobacco taste. \"The result even surprised us, because the taste and aroma have developed much more strongly than we had expected,\" says the Danish master blender Peter Dahlhof, who was and is jointly responsible for the two new tobacco blends.\n\nThe whiskey comes from the Braunstein distillery in Denmark, whose exclusive spirits have already won several awards.",
