        "notes": "Notes:Previous Tin Copy: Named for a book of Jewish mysticism, this is a substantial blend with a special cubed burley base. It derives its subtle essence from the delicate interplay of Turkish leaf and Perique, further mellowed by stoved red Virginias. We are admonished to act with great care in this world, as we are not the final arbiters of actions we judge insignificant. Similarly, a microcosm of leaf adroitly balanced results in intricate and surprising flavors.",
