        "description": "The second blend of our limited series is the Cervantes, a medium-strength ready rubbed blend mixed from burley and Virginias with perique. After his two years of aging it too has its homogeneous and harmonious taste, which, however, stands out from the Rocinante. It comes with a few more edges and corners, which it owes to the high burley content. In contrast to Virginia, his temperament is largely retained with the aging. In the bouquet there are sweet, bready and earthy flavors that dance in a pleasant relationship to the fruitiness and pepperiness of the continuously present perique. The Cervantes is neither an all-day smoke nor a snack, but \u2013 in keeping with American tradition \u2013 a medium-strength burley blend that reveals its complexity when you give it the time you take.",
