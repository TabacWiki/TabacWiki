        "description": "Semois leaf is a rich, pure leaf burley tobacco that is grown and processed in Belgium in the Ardennes Valley (Val Ardennais) - think Battle of the Bulge. Highly reminiscent of smoking a cigar, but in a pipe, it is a fascinating tobacco that has been highly regarded in Europe for well over 100 years. From start to finish, the flavor becomes more and more pronounced, giving a reliable and enjoyable smoke. There are no casings or flavorings added to this tobacco. This is the fine cut version (coupe fine).",
        "notes": "Notes:Semois is a burley varietal that has been developed over hundreds of years in Belgium's Semois River region, in ground that is soggy and fog shrouded.",
