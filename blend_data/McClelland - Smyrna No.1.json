        "description": "Back when Istanbul was Constantinople, Izmir tobacco was Smyrna. \"A rose by any other name...\" These tiny, top-grade tobacco leaves from mountainous Western Turkey across from the Island of Khlos have long been prized as the most aromatic of all Orientals. They grown dense and extremely fragrant in this dry country moistened by Mediterranean Sea breezes.\n\nLook for a whole Smyrna leaf on top of the tobacco when you open the tin.  Notice the tiny hole where it was string up by hand to air cure in a time-honored , labor-intensive process.  There is no Latakia in this blend.  Smyrna is the defining ingredient in this sophisticated Oriental tobacco.  Our intention here is to spotlight the character of this extraordinary, delicate leaf.",
