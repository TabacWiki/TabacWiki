        "description": "Handblended, premium pressed Virginia flake tobaccos. A fine vintage, naturally sweet, in limited quantity. We are proud to offer our 2010 Christmas Cheer pipe tobacco, hand blended and aged in pressed cakes to develop natural mellowness. This 2010 blend is made with a special selection of sugary, red-orange Middle Belt flue-cured Virgina from the 2004 crop near Durham. These ripe, sun-dappled leaves, picked at their peak, should age extremely well in the tin.",
        "notes": "Notes:Each buying season, we look for tobaccos of exceptional quality and distinctive character. In various combinations, their flavors, aromas, textures contribute to the overall excellence of our products. The leaves of different crops and regions are combined to maintain consistency from year to year. With Christmas Cheer pipe tobacco, we treat our discriminating customers to the singular pleasure of a tasting of the very finest in tobaccos of a particular vintage, not worrying about maintaining the flavor and appearance of this product into future years but actually striving instead to present the unique character of a single crop and area. That's what Christmas Cheer pipe tobacco is all about. Happy sampling!",
