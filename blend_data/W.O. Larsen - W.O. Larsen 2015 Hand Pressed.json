        "description": "This is the most intriguing (and costly) pipe tobacco in the world - W.O. Larsen 2015 Hand Pressed. To make this one of a kind blend, master blender Lasse Berg (of My Own Blend fame) hand selected 21 different, top-grade tobaccos and crafted a top note that includes the use of gale leaves that were harvested by hand from the Danich moors. The aroma and flavor are unlike anything we've ever tried, but there's a somewhat familiar old fashioned note to it that is comforting, yet unique. To press the tobacco, Mr. Berg recreated an old hand press to keep things as traditional as possible. The pressed bars are then packed into a specially designed humidor. Manufacturing was extremely limited, so when they're gone, they're gone.",
