        "description": "In October of 2015, while spending a day with Mark Ryan at the L.A. Poche Perique Company in St. James Parish, Louisiana. our own Russ Ouellette asked Mark is he had ever thought of trying to process Virginia in the same method as perique. Mark said that he had thought of it, but was told it wouldn't work. After a bit of conversation, Mark decided to bring down some bright, sweet, yellow, Canadian-grown Virginia to give it a try. The processing time had to be much shorter due to the aggressive fermentation due to the high sugar content, but the result, called Acadian Gold, has more depth than normal Virginia with a malty note unlike anything else.\n\nRuss was so fascinated by the uniqueness of this new tobacco that he wanted to try it blended with a modest amount of latakia and a touch of unflavored black cavendish. The result is a singular, subtle latakia blend with more richness than you'd expect. If you're an English blend fan, get yours while you can because quantities will be severely limited.",
