        "notes": "Notes:Formerly named \"Horst Lichter Kollektion Espressotabak TAB 20\".\n\nThe television chef and rhenish bon vivant Horst Lichter sure enough is one of the most prominent pipe smoker of Germany. He lends his name for several pipe models of the company Vauen. As a chef he knows what makes an excellent flavor. Therefore this Horst Lichter pipe tobacco was developed from a close collaboration with the television star. This way a mild creamy variety of medium strength which has a full bodied, yet not overly dominant note of sweetish espresso. (Horst Lichter is a TV chef that hosts various TV shows in Germany. As he's also a pipe smoker Vauen and Horst Lichter collaborated to create two personalized blends for him.)",
