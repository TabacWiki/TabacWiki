        "description": "Various, high-quality Virginia tobaccos with a high sugar content and natural sweetness were matured in old oak barrels for at least three years together with a small portion of Black Cavendish. The tobacco is rounded off with a fine flavoring with rum, which comes from the award-winning Danish distillery Braunstein. The result is a mildly spicy smoking experience that will appeal to both Virginia friends and lovers of classic, natural Danish tobacco. Here the Virginia and its maturation clearly play the main role!",
