        "description": "This very special Hobbit pipeweed, believed to be one of Gimli's favorites, was secretly stashed on a remote island on Toad Lake in Northern Canada. There, sealed in it's original barrels, it has remained, safe, secure and in perfect condition until its recent discovery. Modern scientific analysis shows that Southfarthing is a deep, rich blend of Latakia from Cyprus, red, yellow and stoved Virginia ribbon from the New World and exotic small-leaf tobaccos from the Orient. Only 250 tins of this rare pipeweed could be produced.",
