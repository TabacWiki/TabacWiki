        "notes": "Notes:Joe Milan is the 'Joe' behind Joe's Blend. The eldest son of Milan Tobacconists' founder J.H. Milan, Joe was a passionate pipe smoker who created his own blend in the 1950's and proudly recommended it to nearly every pipe smoking customer with whom he conversed. As the decades passed, it became more and more difficult to obtain the special tobaccos used to create Joe's Blend, and it finally became impossible to consistently produce the original blend. We decided to reformulate the classic and retain the name in honor of Joe. The \"new\" Joe's Blend is a very light English that makes an excellent choice for those who wish to dabble in the world of English blends. A small amount of latakia is blended with burleys and Virginias to create a smooth, rich, and slightly sweet smoke with notes of nut, hickory, and just a touch of spice. We'd like to think Joe would have thoroughly enjoyed it, and we certainly hope you do.",
