        "description": "Doctor Pipe Pure Dark Fired Flake is one of the most recent launches (September/2024) from the Brazilian company Tabacco Way. As the name suggests, this product only features Dark Fired Kentucky in its composition, known for its smoky aroma that reminds us of barbecue, roast pork and barbecue sauce; The DFK sheets used in the mixture are pressed under high pressure and then cut into long flakes before canning. The result is an extremely smoky, direct and straightforward blend, with enough body to satisfy more experienced pipe smokers and with an intense flavor of pure tobacco.",
