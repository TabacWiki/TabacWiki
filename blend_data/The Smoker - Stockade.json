        "description": "A pure black vanilla Virginia only. It is the close match to the old Captain Black, and is a straight cased vanilla, and in the ribbon AAA cut Virginia. it's then cased and toasted, and that is why it is almost solid black tobacco. The vanilla casing is very mild, and a no bite nor acidity blend. It has been around for over 45 years, and is named after the stockade fencing that was made and invented in Schenectady, New York during the 1700's. It's a blend that burns so well and smooth, and the flavor is a pleasant smoke and doesn't smoke wet.",
