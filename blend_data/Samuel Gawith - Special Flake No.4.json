        "notes": "Notes:From Synjeco: Like most SG flakes, this has a very particular pouch aroma; I could compare it to Flake. 7, though the aroma is different. I could say that the smell is \"perfumy\" and spicy, without being overwhelming so. It's relatively easy to rub out and pack. The colors range from bright to dark. I find that the sweetness and the spiciness go their separate ways: The former is mainly felt on the palate and tongue, while the latter more in the nose and nasal cavity I recommend packing it lightly to obtain a more trouble-free combustion. What I don't appreciate it about it is the fact that it can leave the pipe quite dirty, esp. the shank.",
