        "notes": "Notes:Cornishman was the favorite tobacco of our founder, Jim Reeves. Developed early in The Squire's history, it is quite popular.  \n\nMr. Reeves named Cornishman such because of his fondness an old legend: apparently in medieval England, the king would send tax collectors to Cornwall (whose residents are termed Cornish) to collect tribute; but the tax collectors mysteriously disappeared. Again and again the king would send them, but they never came back! The king, frustrated, learned quickly that he had to send an army with his tax collectors when they visited Cornwall, because the Cornishmen did NOT like taxes!",
