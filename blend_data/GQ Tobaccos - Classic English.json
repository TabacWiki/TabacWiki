        "description": "Our Classic English blend has a special place in the heart of our master blender, Glynn, and which is very closely related to his first ever tobacco mÃ©lange, which we call Nottingham Blend, a tobacco which has fans around the world and gave Glynn his first hands on experience of making a tobacco. This differs slightly from the original, with brown instead of black cavendish and higher proportion of cigar leaf; beginning with a steady and deep foundation of rich Kentucky and stoved Virginias, a few brighter flue cured Virginias are added for that little extra sweetness and to help keep the tobacco burning. The use of brown cavendish adds a creamy, almost woody, over tone to these complex flavours. The blend is finally finished off with a good handful of latakia for that distinct \"English\" taste and aroma. To finish, after the tobaccos have been allowed to settle and marry up, a small amount of cigar filler and binder tobaccos are added for an extra hint of spice. This produces a Classic English blend that we see as our flagship tobacco.",
