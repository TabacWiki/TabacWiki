        "description": "Here is a blend of very special tobaccos for those  smoking around family, friends or in public. It  has three burley\u2019s, two carolina virginias, cased  with true Vermont or Canadian Maple Syrup. A  cousin of it from an earlier blend of mine has  been highly rated over the years and is a very  popular light aromatic blend. I have with it, like  all my other blends, tried to bring back an  integrity to tobacco blending from the past nearly  forgotten today. A very light sweet smoke lends  itself to a room note that everyone around you  will express an affection for.",
