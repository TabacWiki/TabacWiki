        "description": "The 'Strong Mixture' blend is considered the most full-bodied in the entire portfolio of 'Doctor Pipe' line products, being highly recommended for more experienced pipe smokers who can appreciate the natural flavor of the leaves used in its composition and who are more accustomed to high levels of nicotine. The recipe is made up of Arapiraca which is a traditional Brazilian rope tobacco, well known for its fruity and vinegary aroma; Kentucky, with its smoky touch and body power; and, finally, a base of Black Cavendish, with smoothness and sweetness, complete the recipe, providing a true show of flavors and nuances for the experienced pipe smoker to appreciate.",
