        "description": "How would you like to pair a feature film that explores the history, craft, and spirit of pipe smoking with quality pipe tobacco?\n\nFather the Flame is a feature-length documentary about slowing down, embracing life, and learning something in the process. It's also about tobacco pipes. We thank you for your support, and look forward to soon being able to share with you a one-of-a-kind experience about the timeless and transcendent nature of pipes!\n\nStraight Up English was Cornell & Diehl's very first Small Batch blend: An English blend done the traditional way. No topping. No added flavors. Red and bright Virginias and a healthy dose of Latakia. Straight Up.",

No topping. No added flavors. Just red and bright Virginias, a pinch of white Burley, and a healthy dose of Latakia. Straight Up.",
