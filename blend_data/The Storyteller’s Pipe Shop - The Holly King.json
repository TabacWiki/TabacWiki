        "description": "In Celtic folklore, The Holly King was the ruler over the winter months. Along with the winter weather, he also brought the joy of the holidays! In Ireland, Santa Claus derived much of his personality and look from this ancient legend. Our blending artist, Sean Faires, has created a new house blend for the holidays that honors the tradition of The Holly King. It is reminiscent of many of the tastes and smells of this joyful season. Smooth and fruity at the beginning, \u201cThe Holly King\u201d transitions into a spicier presentation throughout the bowl. It is a smooth and satisfying smoke with a gentle room note of baking spice cakes. This blend is a one time seasonal blend! When it is gone it will be gone...",
