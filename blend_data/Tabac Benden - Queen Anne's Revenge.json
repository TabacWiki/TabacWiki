        "description": "Black, sweet, vanilla, fragrant. With our  blend \u2018Queen Anne's Revenge\u2019, we are taking a completely different approach to our other  blends. The motto here was: \u2018It couldn't be sweeter\u2019. Thomas Nitsche from Kopp Tobaccos got down to work again and after a number of increasingly refined samples, the time had come. A pure Black Cavendish with an intense vanilla flavour and an incredible amount of sweetness. The tobacco flavour is still present and the much criticised \u2018cardboardiness\u2019 of Black Cavendish blends does not occur. Just as these types of blends were originally conceived in the 1980s. We are proud of this great tobacco, which was designed for fans of highly flavoured blends.",
