        "description": "A Scottish-styled mixture, Pilgrim’s Muse is perfect for those that love a nuanced Latakia.  Naturally sweet, ready rubbed and flue-cured Virginias blend with light Burley, Latakia, and Exquisite Turkish Tobaccos to form a complex smoke that will give the contemplative pipe smoker hours of cheer.  Pilgrim’s Muse is best enjoyed by pipe smokers that are comfortable “sipping” their pipe and enjoying a single bowl for a long period of time.  A complex and rewarding smoke!",
