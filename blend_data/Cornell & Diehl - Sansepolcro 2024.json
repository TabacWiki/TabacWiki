        "description": "Cornell & Diehl's Small Batch: Sansepolcro is a unique, one-of-a-kind Virginia blend showcasing the finest leaf from both sides of the Atlantic. Grounding the mixture is a selection of exotic KY171 Italian Dark-Fired Kentucky \u2014 grown, cured, and double-fermented on a small farm in the Sansepolcro region of Italy, which boasts a history and tradition of tobacco cultivation dating to the 17th century. Elevating this historic leaf are superlative grades of 2021 and 2022 Red Virginias, 2019 Bright Virginias, and the perfect amount of unsweetened Dominican Black Cavendish, and the entire blend is pressed for seven days to marry the flavors before being sliced into delicate flakes. The result is a complex, alluring smoke with notes of mellow citrus and undertones of soft, earthy, clove-like spice.",
