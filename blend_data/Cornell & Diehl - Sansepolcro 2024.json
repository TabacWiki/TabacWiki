        "description": "Cornell & Diehl's Small Batch: Sansepolcro is a unique, one-of-a-kind Virginia blend showcasing the finest leaf from both sides of the Atlantic. Grounding the mixture is a selection of exotic KY171 Italian Dark-Fired Kentucky \u2014 grown, cured, and double-fermented on a small farm in the Sansepolcro region of Italy, which boasts a history and tradition of tobacco cultivation dating to the 17th century. Elevating this historic leaf are superlative grades of 2021 and 2022 Red Virginias, 2019 Bright Virginias, and the perfect amount of unsweetened Dominican Black Cavendish, and the entire blend is pressed for seven days to marry the flavors before being sliced into delicate flakes. The result is a complex, alluring smoke with notes of mellow citrus and undertones of soft, earthy, clove-like spice.",
        "notes": "Notes:What distinguishes the 2024 iteration, as per head blender Jeremy Reeves:\n\n\"When we decided to do another round of Sansepolcro, I made some different decisions around the Virginias. You will find that the Dark-Fired component ebbs and flows a little more, coming in and out of the flavor profile, and you'll find, I think, the Virginia base to be a little more refined\u2014softer on the palate, sweeter elements of fruit and some more subtle spices. As the blend dries down some you'll notice a little more prominent of the Dark-Fired on the light but it quickly settles into sort of a roast-y, smoky chocolate note that I think is really nice along with the Virignias.\"",
