        "description": "Probably the most traditional and well known Brazilian drugstore tobacco brand. The IRLANDEZ \"family\" used to has on its mixture a balanced blend of burley, golden and medium Brazilian Virginia and sometimes black cavendish tobaccos. This is the 'chocolate alpino' version, a variety of the famous tobacco mixture from this traditional house. Little bit more aromatic than similar blends from the same house, sometimes even unnoticeable and indistinguish differences. Similar to: https://www.tobaccoreviews.com/blend/2489/tabacos-cisne-branco-finamore-ltda-irlandez",
        "notes": "Notes:Produced since 1937, is one of the oldest Brazilian blends still available. The old \"Tabacos Wilder Finamore\" was replaced and now operates under the brand called \"Tabacos Cisne Branco Finamore\".",
