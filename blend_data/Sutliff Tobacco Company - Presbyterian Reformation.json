        "notes": "Notes:Presbyterian Mixture has been an iconic, all-day English blend for decades, blended before the first World War for Reverend Dr. John White, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1925 and 1929. Presbyterian Reformation, however, is quite different from Presbyterian Mixture, its name a play on words between the Protestant Reformation and this blend's reformative nature compared to the original. Comprising Burley, Virginia, and Turkish tobaccos, this Aromatic flake has been lightly cased with cocoa and mocha notes that elevate the natural flavors of its components while leaving it pleasingly aromatic.",
