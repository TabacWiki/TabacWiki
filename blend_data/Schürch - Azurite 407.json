        "description": "I can't be impartial here: This mixture was my favorite in this category and for years. It is the least sweet in this family of tobaccos, though the pouch aroma is still evidently sweet and very pleasant. This will show later in the aroma of the burned tobacco. Upon lighting, there is a slightly bitter taste, combined with a bit of sourness and sweetness. You know that you're in for an enjoyable ride! The percentage of Latakia has apparently been determined with great care and expertise; it enriches the taste of the other tobaccos, adding its woodiness and smokiness to them, without the slightest attempt at assuming more importance than that the blender envisioned while creating the mixture. This is simply a \"delicious\" smoke and a sign of a great blending talent. The room aroma is highly pleasant. Ideally any time of the day, particularly to be smoked in the company of non-smokers.",
