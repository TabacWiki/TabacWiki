        "notes": "Notes:As many of our friends are aware, ‘Thanksgiving Day’, a four-ounce pressed cake has been a tradition since 1939. Year after year, we make it available in a limited capacity starting on November first. This effort keeps us tied to our roots when Major Joseph Peretti, father of Robert Peretti, set forth to blend Peretti’s Burley and English mixtures. The Major wanted to create a blend with the essence of the holiday season, and after countless trials, a mixture of 7 different tobaccos blended with a balance of dark rum and fruit juices was concocted and pressed into breakable 4 ounce cakes. This process has not changed since the first batch was taken from the press.",
