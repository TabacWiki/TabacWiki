        "notes": "Notes:Expressly blended for the connoiseur's palate, Blend 805 has long been our most popular English style blend. This mixture will give unsurpassed enjoyment to those who know the pleasure to be derived from mellowed near east tobacco. Slightly richer than Trafalgar and Red Lion. And possessed of a magical complexity which has made it a favorite the world over. Blend 805 was named so because that was its private blend number when it was first blended experimentally in 1965.",
