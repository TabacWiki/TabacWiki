        "description": "In the year 732, the Frankish general known as Charles Martel used domestic technology developed during the earlier years of the dark ages to win his victory against the invading Turks at the Battle of Tours. This blend is a smokable representation of that great victory. Domestic red and yellow Virginias are teamed with unsweetened black cavendish to hold at bay Turkish tobaccos from Smyrna and Izmir. This mixture is finished off with a kiss of French brandy to enhance it's natural flavors. Through out the bowl one can faintly hear the clashing of swords and the last breaths of the fallen.",
