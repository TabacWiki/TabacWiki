        "description": "Wytchthorn is a rich crossover english blend; a melange of virginias, burley, latakia, and toasted cavendish. A fragrant blend perfect for the chilly autumn months, expect notes of sherried spices, toffee, spirits, and cedar, with a good burn.",
        "notes": "Notes:In the largest Aspen forest in Colorado near Crested Butte, there is a tale of a woman that lives in a natural cave deep in the center of the woods. No one really goes that far into those woods, at least not often after some backpackers came back from trip, speaking of things they couldn\u2019t explain. Like seeing an etheral black cloaked figure with a pointy hat, that moved silently through the woods without touching the ground\u2026",
