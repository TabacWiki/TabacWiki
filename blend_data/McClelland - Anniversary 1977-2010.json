        "notes": "Notes:Originally a limited edition Virginia mixture released in 2002 in celebration of McClelland's twenty-fifth anniversary; McClelland has decided to reintroduce its Anniversary blend in 2005 due to overwhelming demand. \n\nA fine Virginia mixture with just a pinch of latakia to spice things up; this is an impeccable blend, sure to become a favorite.\n\nOriginally released in 2002 to commemorate 25 years of quality tobacco manufacturing, a total of 3000 tins were issued wrapped in commemorative ecru paper with a red wax seal. A second issue, bearing a green wax seal and an updated date span on the paper wrapping (1977-2005), was released in 2005. A third issue, bearing a (brownish) natural wax seal and updated date span (1977-2010), was released in 2010.",
