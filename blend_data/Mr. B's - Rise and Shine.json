        "description": "This tobacco consists of the finest Oriental tobaccos that are balanced with mild bright and red Virginias to produce a light but satisfying smoke. This is perfect for the first pipe of the day and mild enough for all day smoking.",
        "notes": "Notes:This tobacco is part of Mr. B's (Brigham) \"D-Series\", introduced in 2009. Reminiscent of one of the world's top brands, this pipe tobacco is a perfect replacement for an established favourite. If you like the famous Dunhill blends,  you will appreciate the all new Mr. B's D-Series.\n\n\"Rise And Shine\" is Brigham's offering for Dunhill's \"Early Morning Pipe\". These were released during a time when Dunhill tobaccos were no longer in production. Due to French Canadian laws, the tobacco tin features both French and English. \"Aube\" is simply \"Rise And Shine\" in French. Since Dunhill tobaccos have been relaunched by the Scandinavian Tobacco Group, \"Rise And Shine\" was re-branded under Brigham's own flagship under the name \"Maritime Morning\".",
