        "description": "We started with our excellent American Virginia, added a portion of a rare Oriental, a dollop of real Perique, and finished it with a good measure of a specially selected Syrian Latakia. We adjusted proportions until the distinctive characteristics and flavors of each tobacco merged with the others to form a greater whole. Lighting this tobacco is like going on a journey. It starts on familiar territory, with the earthy sweetness of Virginia and the wine-like Perique. But already the aroma and spice of the Syrian woodlands comes wafting through, followed immediately by the exotic fullness and pleasing astringency of the oriental. In a moment, you are suspended in a rich melange of flavor, which scintillates and transforms in your mouth as the bowl burns slowly down, revealing multiple layers of taste. Too soon, the bowl comes to an end, with nothing but a small pile of white ash, a warm pipe, and a fully satisfied palate to remind you of its passage.",
