        "description": "Just like the town of Folkestone, which is spoiled by the mild climate, this Folkestone Blend is very mild and slightly sweet in its flavors. The classic Black Cavendish was enriched by maple syrup and bourbon vanilla. For fans of flavored blends, this blend is a delight. Despite the added flavorings, the burn is dry and hardly develops any condensate. \n\nSince the Folkstone is a mildly aromatic blend, it is also highly recommended for beginners. With all the exciting new flavored tobaccos, it's good to try a real \"oldschool\" Black Cavendish, which is also flavored, but well made. Besides Black Cavendish, the Folkestone contains a small portion of Virginia, as well as a nice portion of maple syrup and bourbon vanilla. This makes it an unexciting, mild warm-sweet delicacy that is especially good to get involved with if you're looking for an everyday companion.",
