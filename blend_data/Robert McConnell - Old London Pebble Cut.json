        "description": "Selected red mottled leaf from Carolina rich in flavor and oils, small Oriental leaves from Macedonia of piquant aroma and bright nut-flavored broad leaf from Virginia, all combined to form the framework of this blend. All are left in bulk to merge and finally a quantity of pure Louisiana perique is added. This blend is then hard pressed as in the old maritime method of \"carrottes\" hydraulics taking the place of spun yarn and muscle. The resulting 'cake' is then cut and stoved to impart a light toasting effect and packed. Surely one of the most popular tobaccos of all it brings back flavours long since forgotten in today's mass produced substitutes.",
        "notes": "Notes:Kohlhase and Kopp replaced the Macedonian Oriental leaf with \"deep black cavendish\", as stated on the website.\n\nNew description: Traditional flake from dark Virginias, deep black cavendish and perique. A tobacco with a fine, natural sweetness, yet vigorous in taste.",
