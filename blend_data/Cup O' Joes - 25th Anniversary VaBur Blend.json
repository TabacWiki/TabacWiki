        "description": "In honor of our 25th Anniversary online, we've teamed with Jeremy Reeves and C&D to create a limited edition Virginia / Burley Cake! This classic VaBur consists of ripe Virginia, earthy burley and a foundation of luxurious black cavendish, pressed into cake form to marry each component into a delicious flavor profile. 25 years in the Adirondacks has made us attentive to the outdoors, where we hope you'll enjoy this sweet, warming & lively blend in front of a roaring fire. Great for veterans & new comers alike, this blend can be enjoyed all day with it's mild body & pleasant, naturally sweet taste & aroma. Only 1,440 beautifully designed tins were produced to commemorate this special anniversary of ours, so don't miss out!",
