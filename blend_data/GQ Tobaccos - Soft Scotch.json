        "description": "To many, whisky is a sharp, fiery experience and so it is with latakia. Many latakia smokers enjoy a wee dram when they are supping away this smoky Oriental. So for this latest addition to the Aromatic Latakia series, we had to combine the two; in a light and mellow setting. We wonâ€™t lie, it has taken us countless months and dozens of re-blends, but finally we got the balance it needed.\n\nWhat starts out as a classic Danish style base of black cavendish with a sprinkling of sweetened Virginia. A sticky casing of vanilla is applied to this base, giving a mellow and velvety smooth foundation. Latakia is then blended in for its cool and creamy nature and topped with scotch. The tobacco has the whisky applied every 2 days for a period of 2 weeks, soaking into all of the tobaccos, before being air dried to the desired moisture content.\n\nThe resulting tobacco has rich, sweet & smoky aroma from the pouch, which carries through into not only the smoke, but also the room note. Thanks to the use of black cavendish and latakia, the smoke is thick, creamy and easy to smoke. The tobacco is mild, with all three tobacco flavours balanced throughout the smoke.",
