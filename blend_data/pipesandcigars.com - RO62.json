        "description": "Per Pipes and Cigars Website: Russ' RO62: I recently was surprised by my co-workers! With my 62nd birthday approaching, they went back through my files and found the recipe for cake tobacco that I really liked that we never produced because the press was tied up with too many other projects. Then they had a small batch made for me, and for sale. This is a real melange of tobaccos including Perique and Latakia, with plenty of flavor but isn't overwhelming.  Get yourself a chunk of what they call RO62 and get ready for something really different",
        "notes": "Notes:When asked what else is in the blend on a discussion board Russ stated \"It was probably the most complex blend in terms of number of different tobaccos used and I liked the result. There are three different Virginias some Orientals and black Cavendish. The funny thing is that as time goes one I found myself using fewer components and still being pleased with the result.\nRuss\"\nhttps://pipesmagazine.com/forums/threads/ro62-calling-blendmeister-russ.70486/",
