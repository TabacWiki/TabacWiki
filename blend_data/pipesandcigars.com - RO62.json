        "description": "Per Pipes and Cigars Website: Russ' RO62: I recently was surprised by my co-workers! With my 62nd birthday approaching, they went back through my files and found the recipe for cake tobacco that I really liked that we never produced because the press was tied up with too many other projects. Then they had a small batch made for me, and for sale. This is a real melange of tobaccos including Perique and Latakia, with plenty of flavor but isn't overwhelming.  Get yourself a chunk of what they call RO62 and get ready for something really different",
