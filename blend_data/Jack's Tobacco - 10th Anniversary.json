        "description": "When Jack celebrated the shop's 10th anniversary in April 2002, we wanted to create a very special blend to commemorate that milestone. After months of development and numerous taste trials, we have finally arrived at a blend worthy to be named \"Tenth Anniversary\". Some of our tasters have described this blend as smooth; others have described it as silky. Still others have described is as well-balanced. All of them are right. The base is medium to moderately matured Virginia tobaccos with lightly toasted cavendish for a sweet undertone. Generous amounts of perique and Syrian Latakia add body and character, and provide exceptional balance which complements the base tobaccos and provides a smooth, cool, dry smoke. A must try if you like a light, spicy English blend in which the Latakia is not overwhelming.",
