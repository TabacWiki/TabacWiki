        "description": "A rich aroma, heady and vibrant, envelopes you. Dark sweetness, laced with tones of leather and subtle spice, rises up from a gentle ember, illuminating the surrounding darkness. As the tiny coal fades, the fragrance lingers, its phantom tendrils curling, beckoning you further into the returning shadows.",
        "notes": "Notes:Conjured by the diabolical minds of Warped Cigars' founder and President, Kyle Gellis, and Jeremy Reeves, Head Blender of Cornell & Diehl pipe tobacco, The Haunting is comprised of the finest Virginia tobaccos and AA grade Dominican Criollo cigar leaf, the same varietal that Warped uses in many of their staple cigar lines. It's the first pipe tobacco from Warped, and upholds Kyle's reputation for prioritizing strict standards, quality components, and nuanced flavors.\n\nAligning well with Warped's \"be exclusively different\" mantra, The Haunting is unlike many other cigar leaf-based pipe tobaccos, which often contain Latakia \u2014 instead, The Haunting consists primarily of cigar leaf and Virginia tobaccos, showcasing the delicious cigar notes and complementary sweetness of the Virginias. It's a blend that bridges the gap between cigars and pipes, catering to cigar and pipe smokers alike.",
