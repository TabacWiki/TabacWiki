        "notes": "Notes:Rich in oil, intense in color, this is prime, sun-dappled leaf ready to age remarkably well in the tin. Each buying season, we look for tobaccos of exceptional quality and distinctive character. In various combinations, their flavors, aromas,  textures contribute to the overall excellence of our products. The leaves of different crops and regions are combined to maintain consistency from year to year. With Christmas Cheer pipe tobacco, we treat our discriminating customers to the singular pleasure of a tasting of the very finest in tobaccos of a particular vintage, not worrying about maintaining the flavor and appearance of this product into future years but actually striving instead to present the unique character of a single crop and area. That's what Christmas Cheer pipe tobacco is all about. Happy sampling!",
