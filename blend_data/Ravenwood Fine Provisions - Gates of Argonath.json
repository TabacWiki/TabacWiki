        "description": "I originally made this purely for myself as I do here and there, but some pipesolk expressed interest so here it is.  This is very heavy balkan blend with LOTS of orientals and a solid amount of latakia, and some virginia. Jar label now included.  Expect tasting notes of woodsy orientals, dark bread and musty earth. Some might find some notes of gingerbread and natural sweetness as well. But make not mistake this is a full bodied english balkan. I only use a 'rich' variety of latakia, so you wont find any 'creosote' taste here however.  This may not be for everyone, but those who like the english blends of old should probably enjoy it!",
