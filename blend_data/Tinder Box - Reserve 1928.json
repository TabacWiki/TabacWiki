        "description": "Tinder Box Reserve 1928 is the first new addition to our tobacco bar in over three years. We went to The McClelland Tobacco Company with our criteria in hand: the tobacco had to be intriguing to the eye, have uniqueness to the nose and be ever so pleasing to the palate. In addition, this is only the second time in history that Tinder Box has introduced a tinned tobacco to our loyal pipe smokers. Because this new blend hearkens our roots, we called upon the touch of a master blender to come up with a blend so unique and so delicious, it is destined to be our top selling tobacco of all time. Tinder Box Reserve 1928 has the panache, the sophistication, the delicacy to satisfy a pipe smoker of refined taste and independent means. It is easy to pack, and has a subtle, natural sweetness. A cool, dry smoke with a light pleasing aroma. The composition of this new tobacco is red Virginia, orange Virginia, Virginia flake, and a touch of burley.",
