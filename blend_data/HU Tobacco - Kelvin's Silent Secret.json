        "description": "Kelvin\u2019s Silent Secret. Kelvin is a young pipe artist and, first and foremost, a nice guy. Of course I had to create a blend to suit his tastes. Kelvin is not a friend of extremes, so he prefers subtle aromas; tobaccos which do not sport the casing as their shining star but employ all their ingredients as team players. The basis of this medium strong blend is made up of different Virginia grades, finished with a little Darkfired Kentucky and Black Cavendish to which a subtle and interesting flavor has been added. The Virginias\u2018 character remains untouched, making for a great interplay between the casing and the tobacco. A delicious treat for relaxing hours.",
