        "description": "Labrador is a classic Virginia/Perique blend comprising the finest Red and Bright flue-cured leaf alongside genuine St. James Parish Perique and a hint of Black Cavendish. It's trustworthy, reliable, and the perfect companion for any fan of Virginia/Perique blends. One of the biggest names in pipe making, Erik Nørding has offered his renowned Hunting pipe series since 1995, in celebration of the outdoors and global conservation efforts. Now, in collaboration with Cornell & Diehl, he offers a line of premium pipe tobaccos that continue that celebration: Nørding Hunter Blends.",
