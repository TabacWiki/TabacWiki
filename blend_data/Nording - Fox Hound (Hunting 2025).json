        "description": "Fox Hound is a blend of cube-cut Burley, matured Red and Bright Virginias, Cavendish, and St. James Perique, enhanced by a pinch of Turkish Latakia. It's a subtly fragrant smoke well suited to calm, early mornings.\n\nOne of the biggest names in pipe making, Erik Nørding has offered his renowned Hunting pipe series since 1995, in celebration of the outdoors and global conservation efforts. Now, in collaboration with Cornell & Diehl, he offers a line of premium pipe tobaccos that continue that celebration: Nørding Hunter Blends.",
