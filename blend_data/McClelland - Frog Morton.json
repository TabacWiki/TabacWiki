It took Frog Morton four years to perfect this unique blend designed for smoking in quiet serenity. It is his proudest achievement.",
        "notes": "Notes:The name Frog Morton comes to us from the works of JRR Tolkien. Frogmorton: A village in the Eastfarthing of the Shire. It stood on the East Road, between the Three-farthing Stone (fourteen miles to the west) and the Brandywine Bridge (twenty-two miles to the east). Immediately to the north of the village, the stream known as the Water broke into two, creating a wide watery region - this feature seems to have given Frogmorton its name, which means \"frog marsh\".",
