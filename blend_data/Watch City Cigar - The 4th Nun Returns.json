Presented in \"Crumble Flake\" format, The 4th Nun returns is our attempt to recreate the experience of the venerable circa 1980's Danish produced Three Nuns. Presented in 4 ounce bags of \"Crumble Flake\",  we hope it makes your Christmas season merrier!",
        "notes": "Notes:This year  we tweaked a popular Holiday mixture we released a couple years ago in a very limited quantity.  \"The 4th Nun\" was our 2016 Christmas Blend. It was our attempt to re-create the original Three Nuns Pre-WW2 recipe which we found while perusing some internet pipe forums. It contained measures of bright Virginia, perique, burley and \"manufactured perique\"- a synthetic perique made by casing tobacco with certain  natural ingredients and flavors.\n\nThis year, we've resurrected the 4th Nun and tweaked the recipe to better reflect the contents of a rare 300 gram tin of Three Nuns from the early '80's that we came across.  We can't make \"curly cut\" or \"coins\" in our little shop here, nor are African and Central American burley available to us. (Facts which almost kept us from attempting to recreate the original recipe at all), so we've taken the exact proportions of the original recipe, added more St. James perique in lieu of the \"manufactured perique and used natural casings and flavorings that better reflect what we experienced in that rare can. We still can't make coins, but we decided to press the blend in our \"Crumble Flake Format\".",
