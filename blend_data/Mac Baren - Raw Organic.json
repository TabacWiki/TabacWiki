        "description": "From MacBaren's website: This is a Virginia style blend made of naturally high sugar tobaccos from Virginia and North Carolina with a touch of Brazilian tobacco leaves from Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina for added taste. The leaves are hand selected for the best smoking qualities and the stems are carefully removed by hand. Finally the tobacco is naturally barn cured using a centuries old process. The length and thickness of the cut is adjusted with each batch to achieve the perfect taste and burn. RAW has a max. 15% moisture for the ultimate smoke, feel and consistency.\n\n Enjoy your favorite smoke in its purest RAWthentic form.",
