Julius doesn't give too much away about who supplies his tobaccos (he mentions a family firm in the US) or what they contain (he just says Cavendish). but they are very very good. Julius is still going strong but into his eighties now - It would be nice to note for the historical record that he not only makes very fine pipes but also sells very fine \"own brand\" tobaccos.",
