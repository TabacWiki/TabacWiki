Take Delight in the warmth and comfort of hot cups of coffee, cozy flannels, sweet maple syrups, and hearty spirits.

        "notes": "Notes:As a thank you for their support of the industry, Sutliff gave several content creators the opportunity to introduce their own blends. Each was given discretion over recipe, naming, and art. Sutliff then produced the mixtures as show exclusives, with all profit going to the respective creators. Flannel Coffee is a collaboration with the Get Piped podcast. It was first offered at the 2024 Chicago Pipe Show, and will continue to be found at pipe shows attended by Sutliff while supplies last.",
