        "description": "John Cotton's Double Pressed Burley is a fantastic choice for Burley-lovers, but also for people who may have tried unflavored Burley blends before and didn't care for them. This blend starts with superb Burley that's mixed with just enough naturally-sweet Virginia to counterbalance the earthy sourness of the Burley. Then, a bit of dark-fired leaf is added for smokiness and spice. These tobaccos are pressed and sliced into flakes. Then, these flakes are tumbled out into a chunky ribbon, allowed to breathe, put into a mold, and re-pressed into a crumble cake. This deepens and enriches the flavor while softening any sharp flavors. John Cotton's Double Pressed Burley will be an intriguing change of pace for the Burley fan and might just surprise people who think they don't care for the flue-cured leaf.",
