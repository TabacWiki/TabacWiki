        "description": "A bold flake of dark fired burleys in a well balanced unity with flue cured Virginias. This flake is hot pressed, meaning that during the pressing, heat is added by steam to the tobaccos which causes the tobacco to intensify the marrying process giving us a bolder tobacco. The robust, earthly flavour of the dark fired burleys shines through in the taste, and you will experience a  deeply satisfying smoke indeed.",
        "notes": "Notes:One of the most fascinating parts about this tobacco that will be sure to confuse a lot of American pipe smokers is that, despite the fact that HH Old Dark Fired contains zero latakia, Mac Baren still considers it an English because of the  method used in its production, specifically the hot press, which presses the tobacco under high heat.",
