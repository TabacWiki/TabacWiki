        "description": "This soft burley and cavendish mixture will be one of the most unique aromatics in your cellar. The pronounced honey topping at times resembles tea, or even rum. The sophisticated pipe smoker will immediate appreciate the essence of Lakeland tobacco characteristics, as rosewater is apparent on the exhale.  A sweet, perfumed delight!",
