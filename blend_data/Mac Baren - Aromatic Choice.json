        "description": "Aromatic Choice makes pipe smoking as easy as possible. Filling your pipe is effortless, and smoking it is even easier, especially if you are a less experienced pipe smoker. The tobacco is a loose cut blend of golden Virginia, the modern Mac Baren cavendish, and it is smoothed-out with a unique burley. The flavor profile comes from selected Virginia tobaccos, which add an inherent sweetness to the blend. Some of the modern Mac Baren cavendish is added to provide a light, sweet taste with faint hint of tanginess. The air-cured burley balances the recipe for a wonderful smoke. The taste of Aromatic Choice is reminiscent of the flavor of ripe exotic fruits. It tamps well, smokes great, and offers a pleasant and relaxing time. The packaging is made of environmentally-friendly recycled cardboard with a handsome reclosable collar, which aids in keeping the packaging sealed after opening, so that Aromatic Choice tobacco can retain its soft and natural moisture.",
        "notes": "Notes:Introduced in 2000.\n\nFormerly called \"Mild Choice\". In 2002 it was decided in the EU that tobacco products are to carry larger warning texts. In that same law it also says that words like \"Light \"and \"Mild\" cannot be used on tobacco products anymore, hence the name change.\n\nDue to further EU regulations, this is renamed and sold in those countries as \"Absolute Choice\".",
