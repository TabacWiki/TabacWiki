        "notes": "Notes:For a limited production run, exclusive to Smokingpipes.com, Mac Baren presents their popular HH Old Dark Fired flake in a plug cut, available in a select quantity of two thousand serialized 50 gram tins. The blend still features the same well-balanced union of dark-fired burley and flue-cured Virginia tobaccos, mixed and heat-steamed both to fortify and better marry the tobacco flavors. In a plug cut, though, Mac Baren skips the flake cutting process. Leaving it as a plug allows the blend to be more easily transported, without the risk of crushing already cut flakes, as well as gives pipe smokers the freedom to slice the plug in accordance with their own preferences \u2014 all while maintaining the robust, earthy flavor that has made this blend a staple of Mac Baren's esteemed HH line.",
