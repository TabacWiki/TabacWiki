        "description": "Enter the rich, wonderful world of Foggy Fox and his woodland friends!  Owl's Haunted Hollow is a desolate and frightening place littered with dead mighty oaks and willows, and a single rotting bridge over a black stream, deep in the heart of Foggy's woods. Owl's favorite blend is his own, rich, woodsy, and sophisticated English blend.  Mild on the tongue, powerful on the senses, this entrancing and mysterious blend leaves a delicious rustic taste in the mouth and a dark, ominous, but enticiing aroma in the air.  \nNot for the faint of heart, but perfect for the wisest and loftiest seated among us.",
