        "description": "The limited edition Davidoff Pipe Tobacco 2017 was created with Virginia tobaccos from India and Bangladesh as well as with Orient tobaccos from Malawi and Turkey. In addition, the exotic black cavendish from Brazil provides a special touch. This diverse blend of different countries of origin has been refined with whiskey, which stimulates the palate with wood, orange and vanilla flavors. The Davidoff pipe tobacco 2017 is limited to 5,500 cans worldwide. The high sugar content in the Virginia tobaccos ensures a pleasant, sweet note. In addition, the pressed Virginia tobaccos add a floral touch to the mix. The creaminess of the black cavendish makes this mixture beautifully balanced and provides a pleasant taste experience.",
