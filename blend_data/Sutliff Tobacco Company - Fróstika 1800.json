        "notes": "Notes:As a thank you for their support of the industry, Sutliff gave several content creators the opportunity to introduce their own blends. Each was given discretion over recipe, naming, and art. Sutliff then produced the mixtures as show exclusives, with all profit going to the respective creators. Fr\u00f3stika 1800 is a collaboration with the Greywoodie podcast. It was first offered at the 2024 Chicago Pipe Show, and will continue to be found at pipe shows attended by Sutliff while supplies last.",
