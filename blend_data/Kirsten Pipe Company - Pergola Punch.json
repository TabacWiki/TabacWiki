        "description": "Kirsten pipe tobacco is selected from supreme quality stock and aged in individual wooden casks to bring out full vintage flavors. Our blending is done by hand from leaf to finished product. We believe that hand production in small quantities is still the most effective quality-control method ever developed. Blended with just the right proportion of Golden Virginia and Burleys. The basic blend of Toasted Cavendish tobaccos takes on a zesty dimension. This is a mixture that gets better as you smoke it all day long.",
