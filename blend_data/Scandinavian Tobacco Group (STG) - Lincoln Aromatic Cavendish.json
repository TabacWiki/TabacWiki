        "notes": "Notes:This blend has been around since the early 1960s in Germany, a time when pipe smoking was considered to be very debonnaire. The sales slogan was, \"Der Mann, der Lincoln raucht...,\" which translates as, \"The man who smokes Lincoln...\" This was always couples with a photo of a ruggedly handsome man doing some very manly activity (akin in a way with the types of images used to market Camel or Marlboro cigarrettes). Though the brand has changed hands several times, it has undergone little change and withstood the test of time. It remains a favorite blend in many a pipe smoker's rotation.",
