        "description": "This is Tabac Manil's Semois tobacco formed into bouchons; Semois is a Burley varietal developed over hundreds of years in Belgium. Bouchons are short cigars shaped sort of like wine corks with a pouched end (like a toque) and made to be smoked in a pipe; the pouched end is lighted. Please see Tabac Manil's semois tobacco listings for a description of taste and other characteristics. There are no casings or flavorings added to this tobacco.",
        "notes": "Notes:Old pipes known as cheroot holders were designed to smoke cheroots, which were short, cylindrical cigars made to be smoked in pipes. This is not popular anymore, but smoking a bouchon in a pipe can be a wonderful experience. Try it, you'll like it.",
