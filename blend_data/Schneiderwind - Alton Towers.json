        "description": "This high-quality and spicy composition of elaborately fermented White Burley tobaccos was only cut into flakes after six weeks of pressing. A slow burn and the typical full, liquorice-like Burley flavour characterize this flake creation. This blend is named after a historic race track in Staffordshire, England, which is unfortunately now closed.",
