        "description": "Our mermaid (Meermin = Dutch for mermaid) is modelled on the Dutch tobacco tradition.\n\nMore precisely, in the Dutch way of producing Cavendish. Not Black Cavendish, mind you, but a refinement through maturation, not through the rapid addition of steam and heat.\n\nThe tobaccos are pressed and stored for some time in the form of large, square \u2018tobacco cakes\u2019 until they are cut up again ready for smoking before being packaged.\n\nThis makes the blend of Virginia, Burley, Oriental and a little Kentucky particularly smooth, aromatic and round.\n\nLast but not least, the blend is given a pleasant dried fruit flavour, which makes it slightly sweeter and pleasantly fragrant.\n\nMeermin is our interpretation of a classic, Dutch old-school blend that has absolute everyday smoke potential.",
