        "notes": "Notes:A buttery-sweet blend with baking spices. It was intended to be a holiday blend, so shortly after the first of the year, it disappeared. \n\nThis is a blend of bright Virginia, mellow white Burley, and soft, silky black Cavendish. It has a creamy, buttery character with background notes of caramel, with cinnamon and baking spice in the foreground. It's not over the top in sweetness or spice.\n\nReminds me of Sutliff, Russ' blends are quite good and rich for the aromatic lover. I'd have to admit, it really does taste just like a snickerdoodle cookie. Very rich with cinnamon and vanilla up front, then honey, butter, caramel, and other spices to finish. I'd say a crowd-pleaser and quite tasty.",
