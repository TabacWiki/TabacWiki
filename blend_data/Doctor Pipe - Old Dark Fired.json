        "description": "The Old Dark Fired blend's main characteristic is the perfect balance between Dark Fired Kentucky and Cypriot Latakia, presenting two distinct dimensions of smoked aromas and flavors in the same blend. Dark Fired Kentucky is known for its smokiness reminiscent of barbecue, roast pork and barbecue sauce; Latakia, on the other hand, has its nuance in the smokiness of a wood fire.\n\nThis duality of two varietals smoked in the same mixture brings a lot of personality to the Old Dark Fired and makes it extremely suitable for pipe lovers who want to start with lataki mixtures.\n\nIn addition to the two main stars of the mix, the recipe is also balanced by a blend of Bright Virginias and Brown Virginias with more than 5 years of curing and a gentle portion of Black Cavendish.\n\nThis mixture results in pleasant flavors, without much complexity but with evolution during the tasting, ideal for daily and unpretentious smokes.",
