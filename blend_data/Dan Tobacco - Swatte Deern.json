        "notes": "Notes:\"Swatte Deern\" is Low German and translates as \"Black Girl,\" playing on another Dan Tobacco blend's name \"Seute Deern,\" translating as \"Sweet Girl,\" the name of which is probably based on the name of the still-extant windjammer De Seute Deern, based in Hamburg, where Dan Tobacco itself was based when these two blends were created.",
