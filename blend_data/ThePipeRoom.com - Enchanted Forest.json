        "description": "A masterful blend of premium tobaccos sets the stage for this enchanting, smokey new mixture. Flavorful leaves add hints of fruit and berries with subtle nuttiness backed by earthy undertones of Latakia, cavendish and red Virginias. This whimsical but dark blend will be a pleasant choice for the journey! Old World myth has it that the Black Forest had witches, dwarfish and ancient knights. There wasn't a single army in all of Europe that would pass through, though going around meant losing many weeks of travel!  No one who ever entered the Black Forest in those days was ever seen again.  Far friendlier, the Enchanted Forest with its elves, nymphs and unicorns will offer many pleasant surprises during a smoke! But; beware, though not as dark, Black Forest lovers will find this blend is not entirely unfamiliar in richness and subtle, dark undertones.  Brings to mind adventurous journeys into deep, redwood forests past shafts of golden light piercing the dark canopy of sky-high tree tops and gently falling upon patches of sweet berries scattered along the dark forest floor. Not for the faint of heart or squeamish.",
