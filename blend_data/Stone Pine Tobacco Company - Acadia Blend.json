        "description": "Virginia/Perique mixtures are among the simplest,  oldest and most enduring blends. And for good  reason: the sweet, warm, full and even sharp  earthiness of Virginia is balanced by the cool,  slightly sour, complex and wine-like quality of  Perique. We set out to realize the full potential  of this classic mixture, using as a base the top  available grade of American Virginia from Virginia itself, together with a generous measure of the original Louisiana Perique from the last remaining farm in the world. The proportions were chosen for the best balance. The result is a tobacco that discloses surprising complexity, a full, soft mouth, and has a pleasant natural tobacco aroma. It can be smoked all day with relish, but without burning the tongue, and yields a clean white ash. A sweetheart of a tobacco.",
