        "notes": "Notes:Another Murrays brand has just come to mind - Yachtsman, which in the 70s was not an aromatic.\nAlso in case anyone wonders why Mick McQuaid ( a Carroll's brand) was on our price list, Rothmans International owned a large slice (or all?) of Carroll's, and we sold their products in the UK, including Sweet Afton cigarettes which took their name from the famous poem by Robbie Burns.",
