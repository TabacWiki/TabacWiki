        "notes": "Notes:Master blender from My Own Blend Lasse Berg and The Danish Pipe Shops CEO Nikolaj Nielsen love to craft tobaccos together as they did with M.O.B. Mr. Nielsen, Mrs. Nielsen, and many others. This one's to mark the move of the store to a new address called Vester Voldgade 92.\n\nNikolaj loves Italian Grappa, and pure Virginia, so the goal was to combine the two. A base of My Own Blend No.45 in ready rubbed form, and oak aged Grappa from Nikolaj's private stock. Then to give it some colour, master blender Lasse Berg adds some blue cornflower leaves; these are only for the look, they don't adjust the flavour. To round it off a tiny amount of maple is added and then it's aged for at least two weeks.",
