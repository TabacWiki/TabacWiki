        "description": "From P&C's website: John Cotton's Double Pressed Kentucky brings a new approach to pressed tobaccos that's almost revolutionary. It starts with smoky dark-fired Kentucky blended with sweet Virginias. These are pressed, sliced in to flakes which are then tumbled out into a ribbon. The tobacco is allowed to breathe and then moved back to the press to be formed into a crumble cake. This causes a second maturation cycle which deepens the flavor and takes any sharp edges off the blend. The aroma in the tin will enrapture you and the flavor is so rich that you'll want to go back for another bowl. Get ready for a new experience with John Cotton's Double Pressed Kentucky.",
