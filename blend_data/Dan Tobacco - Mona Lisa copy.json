        "description": "At Dan Tobacco, tried and tested techniques have been used and a fantastically rich and yet incredibly gentle Black Cavendish has been produced through heat fermentation in the press. Prepared as Ready Rubbed Flake, it forms the basis of this fruity-fresh tobacco, to which a few flakes of light Mysore Virginia have been added to enhance the appearance. Let him put a smile on your face.\n\nFor many years she has been smiling gently at us from the DA VINCI tobacco label.. Now she should be honored herself: the MONA LISA.",
