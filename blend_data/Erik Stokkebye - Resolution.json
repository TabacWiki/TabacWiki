A hazelnut topnote accentuates the blend's balanced mÃ©lange of spices, Dark fruit, bright citrus, and floral characteristics.\n\nDeveloped and blended by Cornell & Diel in cooperation with Erik Stokkebye, maker of fine tobacco for 4 generations.\"",
        "notes": "Notes:Developed through a working partnership between Jeremy Reeves and Erik Stokkebye, 4th Generation Small Batch Resolution pipe tobacco is a full-bodied reimagining of the traditional Danish Virginia flake handcrafted in the Carolinas by Cornell & Diehl. It's the first 4th Generation blend produced by C&D, featuring the finest Carolina mahogany and Canadian bright Virginias combined with matured Orientals from Greece and Turkey, and the pressed, flake-cut mixture offers a naturally sweet, slightly nutty profile with notes of caramelized sugar, baking spice, and citrus zest.",
