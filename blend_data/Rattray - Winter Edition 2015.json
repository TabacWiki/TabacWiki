        "description": "Rattray's Winter Edition 2015 is a warming blend of black cavendish, Virginias and a little burley. It is flavoured with rich fruity cherry, nutty almond and a delicate dusting of cinnamon. These flavours come together to bring you a comforting, radiant sensation, full of the glow of winter cheer and celebration. You are welcomed into the quaint seasonally designed tin by the aromas of Christmas cake, roasting nuts and spice to look upon the choice tobaccos; an array of deep black, chestnut browns and a tinseling of gold.\n\nPerfectly moist with a texture that evinces quality, this blend fills your pipe and lights with joy. It burns cool and thoroughly giving its voluptuous smoke. The limited edition that surely Santa Claus would enjoy smoking is available now and will keep you snug throughout the colder months of the year.",
