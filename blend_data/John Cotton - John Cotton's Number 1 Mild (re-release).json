        "notes": "Notes:John Cotton's No. 1 is a light and refreshing English blend made of matured and bright Virginias, select, small-leaf Orientals and latakia. It's ideal in the morning or as an all-day type of blend. The subtle interplay of the Orientals and latakia are supported by the mellow sweetness of the Virginias The blend has been reconstructed through research and sampling of vintage tins, which triggered blender Russ Ouellette's memories of having smoked the blend in the seventies. For a taste of a traditional, light latakia blend with a great history, give John Cotton's No. 1 a try.",
