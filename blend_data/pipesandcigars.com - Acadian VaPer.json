        "description": "In October of 2015, while spending a day with Mark Ryan at the L.A. Poche Perique Company in St. James Parish, Louisiana. our own Russ Ouellette asked Mark if he had ever thought of trying to process Virginia in the same method as Perique. Mark said that he had thought of it, but was told it wouldn't work. After a bit of conversation, Mark decided to bring down some bright, sweet, yellow, Canadian-grown Virginia to give it a try. The processing time had to be much shorter because of the aggressive fermentation due to the high sugar content; but the result, called Acadian Gold, has more depth than normal Virginia with a malty note unlike anything else.\n\nIn the RO Series Acadian VaPer, Acadian Gold is combined with Acadian Perique for a VaPer blend with an unusually deep flavor and body. It is is one of the naturally sweetest Virginia/Perique blends you will ever try. Get it now, because when it's sold out, it's gone forever.",
