        "notes": "Notes:This tobacco is better known as Soppeng. but, the real name is Ico. Flavouring: smoked Kalosi coffee beans, from Tana Toraja. This is a homemade tobacco blend. It is soft and smooth, yet full-bodied. The flavor comes from an Eastern Indonesian traditional processing method that isn't found in other tobaccos. More specifically, it has a unique method for applying an aromatic. There is no actual casing, so, the aromatic effect comes from the processing method itself. The best coffee beans from farmers in the Tana Toraja region of Indonesia are used as a smoking medium. The coffee beans, when smoked on firewood, will evaporate and deliver a unique taste and aroma to the tobacco. This gives the tobacco a peculiar aromatic feel. The result is slightly grassy, earthy, savory, and smoky. The coffee aroma and taste are faint but present in the background. This is a great everyday smoke which will appeal to lovers of both aromatics or non-aromatics.",
