        "description": "Encased in a wrapper of whole Virginia leaves, Mac Baren's limited-edition Latakia Rolls features a core of spicy Dark-Fired Kentucky and naturally sweet Virginias, alongside a significant percentage of smoky Latakia. The blend is then rolled by hand and stored for five days in wooden crates before being sliced into fine coins. Like nearly all of Mac Baren's spun-cut mixtures, maple sugar is used as an adhesive to bind the rope together, but it is otherwise quite pure in natural flavor, elevating each individual component to the attention of the palate.\n\nLatakia Rolls beautifully showcases the natural character of each varietal, offering a pleasant balance of sweet, spicy, and smoky notes; the incense-like character of the Latakia complements the Dark-Fired's tart, mesquite flavors to produce a smoke that's incredibly complex yet smooth on the draw. No one flavor or component dominates, the cut instead offering a more blended, married profile regardless of how it's prepared in a pipe. Whether folded and stuffed, stacked, or rubbed out into a fine shag, Latakia Rolls is the all-day, spun-cut English blend we've all been waiting for.",
