        "description": "A formidable Virginia/Perique blend that is our personal all-day smoke. Premium red and yellow Virginias are perfectly balanced with unsweetened black cavendish and fine Louisiana perique for a full bodied, complex smoke. When we finished the last version of this blend what came to mind was a hard-working man of the field with a rustic blasted pipe clenched between his teeth which was filled with this blend.",
