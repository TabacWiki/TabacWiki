        "notes": "Notes:The name alone gives an image of misty moors in the north of Scotland. This is a blend of Virginias and Virginia varietals and contains no burley and therefore no Cavendish or other flavoring agents. Oh yes...no Scotch whiskey either, just tobacco. When the E&C range was being developed by Ken McConnell there were virtually no authentic Scottish mixtures being manufactured. Most had some form of casing, and all were blended with burley / Cavendish, an inexpensive filler which Ken assudiously refused to use in his premium tobacco mixtures. As with all the tobaccos in the Elephant & Castle range, tins of \"Isle of Skye\" were hand blended in the McConnell factory on Barking Road in London, England. They are at least 13 years old.\n\nInformation from \"The E&C Story\" on the Marble Arch Ltd. website: http://www.serjacopo.com/e%26c/E%26C_000.html",
