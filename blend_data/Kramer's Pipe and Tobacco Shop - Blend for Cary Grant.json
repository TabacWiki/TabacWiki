        "notes": "Notes:From Kramer's website--I did not find this blend when I first looked through my parent's rolodex. But when a customer noticed Cary Grant's photo and asked what he smoked, I looked more carefully.  Sure enough on the back of one of the cards, my mother had written Cary Grant - and what he smoked.  My parents said he could not have been more delightful - but my mother did say that when he came in the shop, she had to almost trip my father to be sure she got to wait on him! (It kind of made up for Marlene Dietrich holding my father's hand when he repaired her lighters!)",
