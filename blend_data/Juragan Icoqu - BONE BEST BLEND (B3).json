        "notes": "Notes:Flavoring: smoked cocoa beans, floral essences. Description: This tobacco has been put through a traditional Indonesian method called Soppeng. The real name is Ico. This method produces a tobacco very different than that which is made in America or Europe. It has strong Virginia taste with hay like sweetness. The Virginia tobacco is placed in a long bamboo stem which is first seasoned with air cured burley tobacco. Then the tobacco is fermented which gives it its distinct characteristics. The toppings are cocoa-like, citrus, and tropical flowers. The burley is nutty with natural sweetness (honey and molasses). The Kentucky plays a minor role with notes of smoke, wood, earth and grass. The Turkish are also background players, offering hints of spice, floral, and bamboo-wood. It's then pressed like a krumble kake with a color that is slightly more brown than Ico tobacco in general.\"",
