        "description": "JackKnife Plug: dark-fired Kentucky leaf and ripe red Virginia tobaccos, with their deep, earthy flavors, are layered on a central core of golden flue cured for a hint of bright sweetness, then pressed and matured in cakes, and finally cut into 2 ounce blocks. Slice it thick and rub it out for a ribbon cut, thin for a shag, or chop it into cubes. The choice is yours.",
        "notes": "Notes:The first blend in the New World Series - JackKnife Plug was introduced in January, 2011.\n\nFrom GL Pease:  This one has been a long time coming. I’ve had more requests than I can count to make a plug, and to make some stronger blends. There’s something about playing with the tobacco, cutting it, rubbing it out, preparing it for smoking, that connects us more closely with the whole process. A plug like this can be sliced thick or thin, so the smoker gains complete control over the way it will pack and burn. It’s quite rewarding. \n\nMy favorite approach with JackKnife has been to slice it very thin, about 1/32″, and rub it completely into a fine shag. Filling the pipe carefully, not packing too tightly, results in a wonderful, cool, effortless smoke, and the fine cut seems to enhance the sweetness of the Virginias and bring out the subtle, natural perfume of the dark fired Kentucky leaf.",
