        "notes": "Notes:The original concept for Deerstalker called for it to be similar to Escudo - a rolled flake cut into quarter sized disks. This proved impossible as the aged contraption McConnell had for pressing tobacco to this shape wouldn't work! After some discussion, it was decided that it would be a partially rubbed conventional flake. Ken had met some smokers who were unaware flakes should be \"crumbled\" and as he didn't want to print instructions on the tin he decided to crumble it for them. This is a partially rubbed out flake of matured Virginias. By now they are undoubtedly very mature! Many smokers have made it a point to mention that Deerstalker was the finest Virginia they've smoked, and what a shame it's no longer being made. Agreed. The Deerstalker was an E&C original. Like the \"Isle of Skye\" but unlike \"The Roanoke\" - which was substantially, if not completely F&T's Golden Mixture, it was a new mixture created by McConnell to fill a void. As with all the tobaccos in the Elephant & Castle range, all tins of \"Deerstalker\" were hand blended in the McConnell factory on Barking Road in London, England. They are at least 13 years old.\n\nInformation from \"The E&C Story\" on the Marble Arch Ltd. website: http://www.serjacopo.com/e%26c/E%26C_000.html",
