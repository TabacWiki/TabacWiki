        "description": "\"Rule, Britannia!\" was composed by Thomas Arne in 1740, when he set music to the poem of the same name written by Scottish poet James Thomson, and it would go on to become one of the most popular English patriotic songs of all time. Inspired by the song's moving lyrics and music, Drucquer & Sons' Rule Britannia is a rich and complex English blend presented in a distinguished crumble plug. Blend-wise, Rule Britannia is a harmonious mix of exotic Turkish tobaccos, carefully balanced with a medley of Bright and Red Virginia leaf and a touch of Latakia for added depth and smoky sophistication in refined English style. Deep and nuanced, this mixture offers spicy, piquant flavor notes, and its plug cut ensures that it's primed for aging.",
