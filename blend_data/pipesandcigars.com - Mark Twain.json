        "description": "Mark Twain loved to smoke his corn cob pipes. Although there's a lot of conjecture as to what kind of tobacco he enjoyed, it was almost certain that some of what he smoked would have been a burley blend. So what better way to pay tribute to the esteemed author than to put his name on a comforting semi-aromatic pipe tobacco. Mark Twain pipe tobacco is made of rich, ripe burley along with some bright Virginia, finished with a top note that creates a pleasant room note, and a slightly nutty sweet flavor that you can enjoy at any time of day. So load up a cob, sit on the porch and put your feet up and light up, just like Twain used to do.",
