        "description": "There's a fellow in the Ozarks of Missouri who is a master at making smooth as silk blends with components that normally would be considered harsh by some. He's a \"Tamer of Badgers\" of sorts. We call him the \"Ozark Wizard...OZ for short. He kindly gave us this recipe for our Christmas blend.\n\n\"Spill'sbane\" is a blend that defies categorization. It starts off with our \"Simply Red\", and OZ added matured red Virginia and red Virginia cavendish to form the base. A not so small measure of dark fired Kentucky is added and then the blend is spiced both with a bit of perique and cigar leaf. There's a couple other components but we're not gonna tell you because there's got to be a little mystery here, folks. After a couple of \"Hocus Pocus Hoodoo spells\" and some aging, the result is a true melange that harmonizes all the components into a blend that is smooth on the tongue with smokey undertones. Perhaps still the bane of those who detest dark fired tobacco, but then again, perhaps not. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.",
