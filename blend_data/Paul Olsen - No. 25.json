        "description": "This blend is a flake medallion blend, with the medallions being much smaller than either Davidoff Flake Medallions, or Peter Stokkebye's Medallion blend.   These medallions are about the size of a US nickel.\n\nUnlike the two mentioned above, these do not have a core of cavendish and smell slightly of latakia, though it is hard to discern much taste of latakia. There doesn't seem to be any flavoring or top dressing. The blend lights fairly well and burns to a white ash.\n\nAnother review here says this will burn your  tongue.  I did not have that experience, so  perhaps this is not the same blend as the other  reviewer.  This is a fast burning but not hot  burning blend.\n\nThe blend I have indicates the company is a  purveyor to the Danish Royal Court.",
