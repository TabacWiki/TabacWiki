        "description": "From Pipes&Cigars website: About a year ago, we approached Dunhill about bringing one of their old favorites back to market. It was a very smooth Latakia blend with red and bright Virginias that was sold only at the Dunhill stores. It's name came from the comment \"smooth as a...b___'s b_______\". They told us that they couldn't use the name anymore, so bringing it back was off the table. Not to be deterred, we began doing research to recreate the blend, including acquiring an old tin for comparison. Then we found out that they were going to reintroduce the blend under the name BB1938. We had spent too much time, effort and expense to develop our blend not to release it, so we invite you to try Match - BB1938.",
