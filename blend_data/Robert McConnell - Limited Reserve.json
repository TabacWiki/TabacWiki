        "description": "The Robert McConnell Limited Reserve is an ode to the pipe smokers in Great Britain. It combines two of the oldest traditions that the British have to offer - namely the love of pipe tobacco and five o'clock afternoon tea.\n\nAlready at the end of the 16th century, Queen Elisabeth I sent Sir Walter Raleigh, probably the oldest pipe smoker known by name, on an exploration tour in the direction of today's USA. It was he who founded the Virginia colony there. Today it is world-famous for its gentle, naturally sweet tobacco that makes every pipe smoker's heart beat faster. And this tobacco forms the bed for the \"Limited Reserve\". Enriched with deep black Black Cavendish and a pinch of Burley, the result is a mixture that is made for the aromas that make five o'clock tea so famous.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Brit is passionate about having freshly baked scones with clotted cream and a touch of orange jam. And it is precisely these flavors that the McConnell master blenders are using this year. And trust us: clotted cream doesn't just taste good on pastries.",
