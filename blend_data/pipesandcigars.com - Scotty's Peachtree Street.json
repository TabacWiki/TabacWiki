        "description": "I think that the smell of ripe, sweet peaches is one of the most appealing aromas I've encountered. If you agree with me, then you're going to love Scotty's Bulk Blends - Peachtree Street.\n\nThe base of this fragrant blend is a soft and silky black Cavendish, accompanied by some golden Virginia to brighten it up, and mellow, nutty Burley for body. But then the magic happens because Scotty's Bulk Blends - Peachtree Street gets treated to a sweet and fresh-tasting dose of peach flavor that's absolutely mouthwatering. Light up a bowl of this peach pipe tobacco and everything feels like summer. In fact, I'm going to light up another bowl right now.\n\nhttps://www.pipesandcigars.com/p/scottys-bulk-blends-peachtree-street/2019330/",
