        "description": "This tobacco results from the unlikely marriage of an oriental varietal and a New World tobacco prepared by indigenous people in Latin America. Each brings a powerful, assertive flavor. But like our Acadia, the characteristics of the two form an unexpectedly blissful union. This is a very rich and flavorful mixture, yet not at all harsh or overwhelming. It caresses the entire palate, awakening sensations of earth, apricots, leather, roses, cognac, and aloes wood. It has all the satisfying strength and complexity of a fine Havana cigar, and is likewise quite intoxicating. We suggest it should be smoked after dinner, perhaps with an old brandy or well-aged bourbon. A wonderfully seductive tobacco.",
