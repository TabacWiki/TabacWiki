        "notes": "Notes:Translation from the German website: \"Alea jacta est\" - the die is cast. After a long test-period we like to present our new tobacco-mixture \"Tumblin' Dice\" to you.\n\nThe name is derived from its special cutting style from natural sweet bright and medium brown Virginia leafs and in addition a noticeable amount of our precious original Louisiana perique. First it's cut length wise, afterwards it's pressed for some time, and then it's cut crossways and finally stored to mature. Thus arise these 6mm wide cubes, of which every one contains the whole tobacco-mixture.\n\nDuring pre-marketing testing phase sold as Torben Dansk C. C. V/P.  It was only available in the store itself and wasn't in the catalog, nor the online shop.",
