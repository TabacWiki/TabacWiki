        "description": "Lakeland Brickle is a combination of Virginias (mostly red), along with dark, tangy burleys (which add depth, spice, and strength) and infuse them with traditional Lakeland-style flavors such as rose and a tonquin-type (among others), but with a light hand to avoid the “soapiness” that some people dislike. We then heat treat it and put it under pressure to further develop the flavor and body, and finish by vacuum sealing it in 8 ounce bags. The mildly sweet but robust flavor is intriguing and seems to get better with each successive bowl.",
        "notes": "Notes:The original Lakeland Brickle has been a big hit for us, but we received a number of \"I liked it, but...\" emails and phone calls. What people were requesting was a version that would be stronger than the original with a more robust scent. And a number of people wanted smaller packaging. We listened to you, so we're announcing Lakeland Brickle Fortissimo; a fuller-bodied blend with dark air-cured, dark fire-cured and perique with a richer flavor including juniper, lavender, and clove, and packed in 4 ounce. bricks.",
