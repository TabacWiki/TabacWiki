        "notes": "Notes:This limited-edition blend was released at the 2019 Chicago Pipe Show. This blend is dedicated to the legacy of the last 19th century American existential horror writer, H.P. Lovecraft. Taking it's inspiration from the 1920's short story with the same name, a reckless scientist's experiment opens the door to our world for monsters from another dimension. From Beyond was subsequently adapted to the 1986 film of the same name by horror director Stuart Gordon, and also served as inspiration for the 2013 horror film Banshee Chapter.",
