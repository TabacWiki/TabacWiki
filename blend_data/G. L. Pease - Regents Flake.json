        "description": "A generous measure of fine Izmir leaf is layered on a sturdy foundation of mature red and sweet bright Virginia tobaccos, then pressed and allowed to mature and ferment in cakes before being sliced and tinned. This is one for the lover of Oriental mixtures, with their exotic and enticing incense-like aroma and brilliant flavour. Rub up a flake or two, fill a cherished pipe, and prepare for an exceptional smoking experience.",
        "notes": "Notes:Regents Flake starts as a base of red and bright Virginia leaf, seasoned with generous amounts of fine Oriental tobaccos. A very small percentage of perique is added to enhance the fruitiness of the Virginias, as well as to work its magic amplifying some of the lovely exotic, almost floral qualities of the orientals. Pressing and aging in cakes brings out the best of the leaf, after which the blocks are cut and sliced into flakes. The aroma is rich, malty, fruity and just a little earthy. In the bowl, beautiful Virginia flavors, subtly sweet, are enhanced by the spice and sweet/tart character of the orientals, and the room note is wonderful.\n\nTemple Bar is made from the same components, but optimized as a plug version of Regents Flake.\n\nReleased 7/12/2016",
