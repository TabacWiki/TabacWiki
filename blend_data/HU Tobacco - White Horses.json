        "description": "White Horses - I love the raw charm of the Bretonic coasts. The monotone ride of \"White Horses\" - that's how you call the white crests of waves - stimulate my thoughts just as much as the pleasure of smoking a pipe with a stout tobacco. White Horses is a medium strength tobacco consisting of a high percentage of sweet Virginias, Kentucky, some Havana leaf and perique. Kentucky isn't thought of as being complex, yet well blended, it lends White Horses exactly the touch of spicy and boldness that you'd wish for, without making the blend monochromatic. The White Horses is just as lovable as the raw, Bretonic coasts.",
