        "notes": "Notes:John Cotton's pipe tobaccos originated in Scotland, so for their first limited edition aromatic in the Double Pressed series, they named it after Glasgow, the most populous city in Scotland. It starts with pressed, sweet, and zesty Virginia varietals, hearty burley, and delicate toasted black cavendish. The tobaccos are treated to a singular top note that produces a gloriously sweet and woody flavor while allowing the smooth tobacco flavor to come through and creating a pleasant and comforting aroma. The crowning touch for this outstanding blend is the second pressing. After being initially turned into a flake, the tobaccos are tumbled out and allowed to breathe, and then are returned to the mold to be re-pressed into an easy-to-prepare crumble cake. This marries, matures, and mellows the leaf to deliver a smooth and flavorful experience that is nothing like anything you've ever tried before.",
