        "description": "This new blend is hard to describe, but its name comes close - Sweet & Savory. We use a variety of yellow and red Virginias for sweetness, Yenidje and Basma for a naturally floral note, Perique for its \u201cplum and pepper\u201d character, and smoky, spicy dark fired Kentucky for complexity and \u201ckick\u201d. This is a blend with a \u201cwhole mouth feel\u201d, meaning that all of your taste buds are involved while smoking this unique combination What we found most surprising is the cross-section of pipe smokers who enjoyed this tobacco. People who prefer straight Virginias, Virginia/Perique, Burley and even Latakia and aromatic smokers said they enjoyed it. Even better, many wanted to know how soon they could buy some of their own. Whether you\u2019re looking for a flavorful treat to add to your rotation, or an all-day, everyday type of blend, see what Hearth & home Marquee Series Sweet & Savory has to offer.",
