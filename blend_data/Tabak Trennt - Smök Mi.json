        "notes": "Notes:In the middle of the fifties, German tobacconists took over the procedures customary in the USA to compensate for differences in taste between the various tobacco producers by adding artificial aromas. It was also possible to process inferior tobacco varieties, as the aromas guaranteed a uniform taste, which, as Karl-Heinrich Trennt had always said, had nothing to do with tobacco. \n\nThis development sparked horror in him, the connoisseur of pure tobacco. He began to mix tobacco varieties from various high-quality tobacco leaves of the classical English type. His father already did this when he developed the \"Abu Riha\" variety in 1928. In a series of attempts and constant review, the \"TT 91\" was created in 1961. \n\nInspired by the sales success, Karl-Heinrich Trennt created six more tobacco mixtures in the next years: 1962 the \"Tobac\" variety; 1963 the \"TK 93\", 1964 the Oriental mixture \"TW 64\"; 1970 to the 100th anniversary of the company the \"Jubil\u00e4ums-Mixture; 1975 the \"Sm\u00f6k Mi\" and in 1978 the \"78\".\n\nIn the Hamburg tobacco factory Walter Wehde, the natural tobacco varieties of the company Th. Trennt are still produced in unchanged formulations. Since the fifties, both companies have held an intensive, trusting and successful cooperation over decades, even after Mr. Wehde sold his company to the company Kohlhase & Kopp on January 1, 1987 in order to go to well-earned retirement.\n\nfrom the website of \"Tabak Trennt\" (in German) http://www.tabactrennt.de/webseite/chronik-1870-1995/",
