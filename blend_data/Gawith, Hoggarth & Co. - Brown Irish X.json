        "description": "Made with the same way and ingredients as the Black Irish X (a process of spinning dark fired wrapper leaves. The filler is again, predominantly dark fired leaf with the addition of a small percentage of dark air cured Indian leaf.). Brown Irish X (same as twist) comes straight off the spinning machine without any additional processing. The absence of the pressure and heating process means this tobacco retains all of it's strength.",
        "notes": "Notes:Pipesandcigars.com list the components as burley and Kentucky. Smokingpipes.com list the components as Virginia and provides the following description: \"Brown Irish X by Gawith, Hoggarth & Co. is dark fired and dark air cured. This rope is stoved less than the Black Irish.\"\n\nGawith Hoggarth says, \"All our Kendal Twist tobacco varieties (Pigtail, Bogie, Flavored Twist, Irish X and Irish XXX) are manufactured by the same spinning process using dark fired wrapper leaves. The filler is again, predominantly dark fired leaf with the addition of a small percentage of dark air cured Indian leaf. They are therefore strong tobaccos. Black Twist (Black Irish), because the cooking process removes some of the stronger tar and nicotine elements, provides a milder smoke than the brown twist.\"",
