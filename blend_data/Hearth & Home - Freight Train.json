        "description": "Another creation from mastermind Russ Ouellette, this blend was named because after you smoke it, there is a chance that you'll feel like you were run over by a train. The mixture consists of a blend of Red Virginia, dark Burley, dark-fired Kentucky, a bit of unflavored Black Cavendish and Perique. The result is a nutty and earthy blend with a slightly spicy backbone that burns cool and produces thick clouds of smoke. It has a very stout body and isn't for the timid, but it's a satisfying blend meant to kick up your day.",
