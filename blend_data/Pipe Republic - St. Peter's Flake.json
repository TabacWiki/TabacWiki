        "description": "The St. Peter`s Flake is a traditional Virginia and perique flake. In this flake, the spicy perique and the naturally sweet Virginia come especially to the fore. The aroma is very distinctive and medium-bodied. It convinces with its clean and slow burn.\n\nDo you like flakes? Especially Virginia perique? Then you should definitely take a closer look at the St. Peter's Flake! The dark to medium brown flake slices are neither mixed with gum arabic, nor with other adhesives, so that he can be easily rubbed. The scent is incredibly spicy-aromatic and reminiscent of black bread, pepper and leather. The relatively high perique content gives the flake structure and strength, and makes it a real treat for aficionados. Not too strong, it burns down wonderfully evenly from small to medium pipe bowls. As with all of our house blends, we have taken care to ensure a clean and dry burn. A highly interesting flake, with a certain amount of sophistication and pithiness, just waiting to be discovered by you!",
