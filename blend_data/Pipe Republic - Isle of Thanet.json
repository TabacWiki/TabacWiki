        "notes": "Notes:The idea with the Isle of Thanet was to create an English tobacco that in a sense goes back to the \"beginnings\" of this blend genre. \n\nSo we first determined what should not be included in this tobacco. Namely, burley and black cavendish. This is often added to English blends to tone down the tobacco and give it some sweetness.\n\nWe have also omitted perique and dark fired Kentucky so as not to make the tobacco too potent and distract from the actual structure and aromatics.\n\nTherefore, the Isle of Thanet contains a good 40% Latakia, about as much finest small leaf Oriental tobaccos and 20% dark Virginia to give the whole something to hold on to.\n\nThe Oriental comes exclusively from Turkey, Izmir and Basra varieties. The Latakia comes from Cyprus.\n\nThe Virginia comes mostly from the North American continent, but also from South America, and a small part from Tanzania.\n\nThe result is an incredibly aromatic, full-bodied blend that goes all out with its smokiness, but retains a creamy elegance that gives it the unusually high dosage of Oriental tobaccos by today's standards.\n\nThe Virginia gives the blend structure, spice and earthiness.\n\nAt the same time, it is amazingly complex and multi-layered in the course of the smoke.\n\nWith the Isle of Thanet, the pipe smoker can move back to times when English blends were not overloaded by too many ingredients and overly complicated.\n\nOf course, it does not contain any additional flavorings.\n\nThe moisture content in this blend is slightly higher than in the rest of our tobaccos. This was unfortunately necessary for the ingredients to combine and mature ideally.\n\nFor the perfect smoking experience, we therefore recommend to let the Isle of Thanet dry a bit.",
