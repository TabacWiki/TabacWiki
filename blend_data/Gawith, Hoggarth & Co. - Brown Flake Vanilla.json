        "notes": "Notes:From GQ Tobaccos' web site: After a number of conversations at the Nottingham pipe club, we have decided to have Gawith Hoggarth make us some interesting new flakes. While there are a few vanilla flakes out there at the moment, most tend to be fairly golden Virginia & burley blends, and we wanted something a little richer. With Gawith & Hoggarth's Brown Flake being a staple for thousands of smokers around the world, it seemed the obvious choice to go for. So what began life as this classic blend of the high quality Virginias with a little burley. The selection of Virginias makes for a cool and smooth smoke, while the burley adds a little more body.\n\nThe use of natural vanilla extracts and simple sugars makes for a tobacco which smells good enough to eat. As soon as you open the bag, you are greeted with what reminds us all of vanilla fudge, but of course its how it smokes that matters. As with all of Gawith & Hoggarth's flavourings, the flavour comes through well, and last throughout the bowl. The sweet and highly aromatic vanilla taste combines stunningly with the nutty and tasty flake.",
