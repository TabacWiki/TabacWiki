        "description": "As a rich and cool tobacco with a room note to please those who don't like latakia or Kentucky, they are pungent when burning! Built on a foundation of rum soaked brown twist, with some sweet gold and black cavendish to tone the blend down a little. This tobacco burns slowly and works well in a large bowl and smokes very cool with a good dose of vitamin N (nicotine). The use of honey and spices, along with the Rum makes for a sweet aroma that pleases most.",
        "notes": "Notes:Rum & Honey was a personal blend of Glynn's he made years ago as a tobacco which smells nice, but isn't just hot air. \"An aromatic with balls\" -- Glynn's one line on this one.",
