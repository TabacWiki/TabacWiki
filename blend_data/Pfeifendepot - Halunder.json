        "description": "Halunder, that\u2019s the inhabitants of Heligoland and at the same time it is the name for the special Frisian dialect that is still spoken by some of the people here. Anyone who sets out for the red rock of Heligoland should be wind and weatherproof, just like this natural flake, with which you will cut a fine figure even in the eye of the hurricane or on the back of a gray seal. Individual leaf layers from hot air and air-dried Virginias harmonize here with a strong burley. In the tobacco press, this turns into a strong, leathery tobacco that offers an authentic tobacco taste and a noticeable scent of tomato paste (ketch-up) with light floral accents. For advanced users and those who want to become one.\n\nType of cut: Flake\nType: natural\nAroma: 0\nStrength: 4",
