        "description": "Perique is a powerful tobacco, both in flavour and strength. The long fermentation process makes it a tobacco commonly used as a condiment, used in small proportions to enrich the taste. You would expect to find perique with a gold Virginia or mixed in with a powerful Balkan/English blend. \n\nSwamp Flower however, is different story altogether; based upon a heavy foundation of Kentucky and fire cured Virginias, this gives the blend a solidly rich and earthy footing. In order to give the tobacco a subtle sweeter edge, some flue cured Virginias are added together with a classic Lakeland geranium topping; then along comes the perique; a hefty portion is used to give the blend a little more oomph; after which a minuscule dusting of Turkish Izmir is added to furnish the blend a better combustion without making little difference to the tobacco. \n\nThe smoke is very rich, dark and complex; and the high amount of perique bestows this blend a spicy experience, however, it confers it with a delicate light floral contrast. It is not a smoke for those who don\u2019t like tobaccos with high nicotine content, as this packs an all-powerful punch!",
