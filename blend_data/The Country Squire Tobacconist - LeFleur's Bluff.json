        "description": "Small Batch- Limited Release (2 oz. Bags) \n\nLeFleur\u2019s Bluff is the name of a historic village in central Mississippi on the banks of the Pearl River.  Named for Louis LeFleur, a French Canadian trader, the community \u2013 which was little more than a trading post \u2013 eventually grew into what became the City of Jackson \u2013 capital of our state and home of The Country Squire.  We offer this Virginia-Perique in honor of our home, and with the hopes that it will bring you much smoking pleasure.\n\nA variety of choice red and matured Virginia tobaccos are combined with a generous portion of spicy St. James perique from the bayous of Louisiana.  These tobaccos are hand-blended and then carefully pressed for several days to achieve optimal smoking consistency and flavor.  The cake is then hand-rubbed into a m\u00e9lange that loads easily, burns cool, and is kind to the mouth.",
