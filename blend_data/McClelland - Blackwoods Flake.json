        "description": "The characteristic, natural sweetness of mellow, red Virginias mingles inextricably with the richness and inherently spicy aroma of black stoved Virginias in this doubly aged red and black all-Virginia cake mixture. An artistic achievement in tobaccos for the pipe, this beautiful mottled flake is incomparable in smoothness, balance and refinement.",
        "notes": "Notes:From McClelland: Occasionally we meet someone whose familiarity with a variety of tobaccos, sensitive palate, and desire for \"that special tobacco\" provide an inspiration for us.  In seeking to satisfy a taste other than our own, we pleasantly surprise ourselves with beautiful results.  This is what the Personal Reserve Series is all about.  We developed this concept early on as a way to enhance our creative spirit.  We are proud to offer these fine pipe tobacco blends, and hope you will enjoy them.",
