        "description": "From the word go you are greeted with a very rich and pungent smoking experience, packed full of the oaky smoky flavours you would expect from that much latakia. The Virignias are not in the forefront of this blend at all, they carry the more savory along beautifully and creates a sweet current which all the other flavours float. Thanks to the quantity of latakia and the Izmir, the blend has a spicy nature which grows throughout the smoke, ending in a very peppery finish.",
        "notes": "Notes:Erin from the Okanagan Pipe club contacted us and asked if we could make couple of \u201cClub Blends\u201d for them. A Balkan and an aromatic was the brief and over several weeks we experimented with various ideas. The first blend we focused on was the Balkan (#1), the brief was reasonably simple, a latakia heavy Balkan blend with an oaky/woody side to it, some spice and underlying sweetness.\n\nUsually we use a single latakia across all of our tobaccos, it carries a wonderful char grilled flavour to it, whereas this needed to be a little more \"oaky\". So after various alternative latakias, we found a combination of the two which worked perfectly. Normally we would call the Virginia component of this style blend the base, but with over 50% latakia, it just didn\u2019t sound right. The same delightful steamed Virginia we use in the Askwith Kake, this blended with a divine sweet and citrusy flue cured Virginia. To give this tobacco its other oriental content (ALL UK blenders class latakia as an Oriental; well it is really) a wonderful spicy and woody Izmir is added.\n\nGetting the balance took a fair amount of tweaking and juggling to hit the nail on the head, but we got there. \n\nIf you like your latakias punchy and pungent then this has to be one for you, it won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but Glynn certainly had fun making it.",
