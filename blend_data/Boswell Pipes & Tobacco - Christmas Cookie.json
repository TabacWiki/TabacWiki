        "notes": "Notes:One of the First blends Dan Boswell Created in November of 2002, Dan worked on this blend for 7 months to get it just right for Christmas of 2002 which he created an amazing, smooth, delightful, and no bite blend. When it was offered to our Boswell Customers it was to start as only a Seasonal blend but right after Christmas of 2002, we went to take it off the counter and the out pour of our customer saying \"We need it all year\" we could not say no to that. So that is why Christmas Cookie is available all year round.",
