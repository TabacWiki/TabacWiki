        "description": "Historically, here in the Northeast, our forests are littered with lines and lines of old stone walls. Built throughout the centuries to designate one mans land from another, they were often the site of casual conversations between neighbors. Scotty has devised a smooth casual blend to keep in that tradition of social congregations. Toasted cavendish, burley and golden Virginia season with just enough Cyprian latakia to produce a cool-smoking, sweet full bodied, slow burning tobacco. Pick some up today and enjoy it with a friend.",
