        "description": "In long gone times, when imposing sail ships crossed the Seven Seas, English sailors were popularly called \"Salty Dogs\". They always took care to have a pocket sized block of sweet Virginia tobacco with them, which they would take a slice off to then rub out and smoke in their cutty pipes. In heavy weather, they would opt to just bite off a corner to enjoy as a stimulating piece of chewing tobacco.\n\nSelected sweet Virginias with a small pinch of perique, classically enhanced with Caribbean rum, are matured over a long time in the press. The result is a dark brown, full and pleasant pipe tobacco in traditional style offering you a comfortably cool and smooth smoking experience. Unlike ordinary flakes, it was not cut into slices, but packaged as a solid piece of real plug tobacco. Enjoy it in pipes with smaller bowls. (translated from Dan Tobacco's website)",
