        "description": "Ripe red and bright flue cured tobaccos are joined by piquant Acadian perique and a balanced measure of smoky dark fired Kentucky. The leaf is pressed and matured in cakes before being cut into 2oz bars, resulting in a bold blend for Virginia and perique fans.",
        "notes": "Notes:The second blend in the New World Series - Triple Play was introduced in May, 2011.\n\nFrom GL Pease: After the wonderful reception of JackKnife Plug, more than a few of you asked for a Virginia/perique plug. Some suggested adding perique to JackKnife, which, of course, I tried, but the balance was wrong. The overall profile was nice, but the amount of dark fired leaf competed with, rather than enhanced the addition of perique. If enough perique was added, the Virginias got lost. After some fiddling with the percentages of the different Virginias, and reducing the amount of dark fired leaf, everything came wonderfully into balance, and the result is Triple Play.\n\nOnce again, the leaf is pressed and matured in cakes before being cut into 2oz bars. I think the results are fantastic, and this one will appeal to lovers of classic VA/perique blends, with the added fun of having it in plug form.",
