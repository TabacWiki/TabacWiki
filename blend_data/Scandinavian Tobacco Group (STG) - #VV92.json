        "description": "House blend to celebrate their new shop: #VV92 = Vester Voldgade 92 Master blender from My Own Blend Lasse Berg and CEO from TDPS Nikolaj Nielsen are good friends and love to develop new tobaccos. They have developed several tobaccos together like Mr. Nielsen, Mrs, Nielsen and others. The idea was that this time it should be a tobacco that Nikolaj would prefer and at the same time it should mark the move of the shop to a new street called Vester Voldgade 92 = #VV92.\n\nNikolaj loves the Italian grappa and pure Virginia so the goal was to combine these two things. The base of the tobacco is My Own Blend 45 in a ready rubbed version added oak aged grappa from Nikolaj's personal stock. To give it some colour, Masterblender Lasse Berg adds some blue cornflower leaves. These are only there for the look and does not make it sweet. To round it all is added a tiny bit of maple. The #VV92 has matured for minimum two weeks. A beautiful tobacco with a natural flavour and a hint of good grappa.",
