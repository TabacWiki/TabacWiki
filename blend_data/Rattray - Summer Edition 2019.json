        "description": "The Summer Edition 2019 pays homage to the life of Charles Rattray, founder of the House of Rattray in Perth, Scotland, and creator of many traditional tobacco recipes. Ideas for new mixtures often arose at the sea, which Charles loved so much and was the source of his inspiration. For this reason, the can of the Rattray's Summer Edition 2019 was designed in maritime design.\n\nA golden, sweet and sour Virginia, backed by a honey flavor. Broken Virginia, small press bars, for a cool smoke, and black cavendish, flavored with the intense fresh aroma of watermelon. The aroma of watermelon continues with this tobacco very well in the mouth and transports a cool palate experience.",
