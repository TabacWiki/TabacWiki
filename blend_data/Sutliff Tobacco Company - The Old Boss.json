        "description": "Celebrating our 175th Anniversary, it was only fitting to bring back the Old Boss. Presented with founder Henry Sutliff\u2019s portrait just as it was over a century ago. We dug into our vault for an old classic. Before Mixture no. 79, before Heine\u2019s blend, there was the Old Boss- a latakia heavy English with the finest red Virginias and Turkish leaf, a touch of perique for spice and burley to round the edges. Light up and enjoy this throwback and celebrate 175 years with us.",
