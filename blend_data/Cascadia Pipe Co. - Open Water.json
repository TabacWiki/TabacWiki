        "description": "Cascadia pipe Co.'s tobacco offerings are all presented in plug form making them ideal for people who enjoy outdoor activities since plug tobaccos stay moist longer. Open Water is a great option for those who prefer aromatic pipe tobaccos. This solid plug of select Virginias and hearty burley is treated to a subtle and fragrant dose of fruit essence that's not overly sweet. It's a medium-bodied blend that's remarkably satisfying and will be a fantastic choice for aromatic fans while on the go. When you're ready to relax around the campfire with a pipeful that you'll savor along with the people around you, open a tin of Cascadia Pipe Co. - Open Water.",
