        "notes": "Notes:The celebrity chef and passionate pipe smoker Horst Lichter already lends his name for several pipe models of the company Vauen. Hence it's only logical that he, the expert regarding taste, makes a detour in the section of tobacco. What came from this is creative because Horst Lichters Rotweintabak (=red wine tobacco) is anything but ordinary. This blend of mild aroma, paired with one of the most complex luxury foods carries nuances of an unique, slightly sweet red wine that will also spoil to the intermediate pipe smoker with an interesting smoking experience.\n\n(Formerly named \"Horst Lichter Kollektion Rotweintabak\").",
