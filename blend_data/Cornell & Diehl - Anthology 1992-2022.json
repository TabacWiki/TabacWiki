        "description": "An expertly crafted, commemorative mixture, Anthology 1992-2022 is the culmination of 30 years of evolution and expertise, showcasing the interest, passions, and themes of Cornell & Diehl over those years. Elevated by many of C&D's favorite components — including the iconic SM2-18 and TA-20 Carolina Red Virginias, 2003 Bijou Virginias, top-tier Canadian Brights, as well as genuine St. James Parish Perique — this special-edition mixture highlights the blending house's unique approach to the Virginia/Perique family, delivering a naturally sweet, bready profile with notes of zesty citrus, rich stone fruits, and figgy spice.",
        "notes": "Notes:Anthology 1992-2022 is a glowing testament to the synergistic working relationship that C&D has cultivated with farmers and tobacco merchants over the years, especially with a single Perique farmer in St. James Parish, Louisiana — illustrating the benefits of growing, harvesting, and processing authentic Perique according to precise, time-honored methods.",
