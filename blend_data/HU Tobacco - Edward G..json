        "description": "Robinson played the notorious gangster and anti-hero in \"film noir\" movies and was a fascinating figure in American cinema of the 1930s and 1940s. Gaining fame as the power-hungry slob and gangster, Edward G. Robinson led the life of a sensitive art enthusiast and avid pipe smoker. In its varieties and contrasts Edward G. Robinson's life shows similarities to \"Edward G Ready Rubbed Flake\". Gaining a tartly sweet character, the dark and pressed Red Virginias of assorted provenances have been finished with a little perique and brown Virginia.  A touch of Kentucky tobacco gives the blend that extra something. \"Edward G\u2026Ready Rubbed Flake\" captivates by its natural sweetness, which makes a mark on it without dominating. It is a blend just as distinctive, complex, interesting and multi-faceted as Edward G. Robinson's life and work.",
