        "description": "Many of the blends created at ESF were originally custom orders. Gemini (\u2018the twins\u2019) has two sides: The first side is two red Virginias, Bright Virginia and Perique, pressed together. The second side is Latakia and unsweetened Black Cavendish pressed together. These two sides are then rubbed out and pressed together! The result is amazing!",
        "notes": "Notes:ESF never includes sweetening agents unless they are specifically mentioned as an integral part of the blend or as an option; propylene glycol is not used as a carrier for flavoring agents. The goal at ESF is to provide a custom alternative with consistent, repeatable performance, to the discerning pipe enthusiast. Pressed if requested. We try to create blends that captivate your attention, take time to unravel, and take you on a journey. Custom blend requests are welcome!",
