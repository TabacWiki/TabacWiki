        "description": "Fairbourne is an interesting Virginia/Perique blend containing Lemon Leaf Virginia, Long Cut Virginia, unsweetened Black Cavendish, Stoved Red Virginia, Flue-cured Kentucky and Perique. The content of the Perique is just enough to give it a stone fruit note but sufficient so as to allow this higher alkaline leaf to keep balance with the more acidic flue-cured Virginias. This combination reduces the potential for tongue bite and creates a tasty and truly delicious VaPer.",
        "notes": "Notes:ESF never includes sweetening agents unless they are specifically mentioned as an integral part of the blend or as an option; propylene glycol is not used as a carrier for flavoring agents. The goal at ESF is to provide a custom alternative with consistent, repeatable performance, to the discerning pipe enthusiast. Pressed if requested. We try to create blends that captivate your attention, take time to unravel, and take you on a journey. Custom blend requests are welcome!",
