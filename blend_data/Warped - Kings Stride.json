A sumptuous selection of cigar leaf, pressed and steamed into an exquisite Cavendish, bestows unsurpassed delicacy and mystique.",
        "notes": "Notes:Known for their boutique, Cuban-style cigars, Warped is curated and supervised by founder Kyle Gellis, an entrepreneur and lover of all things bespoke and luxurious. He has a taste for finery and approaches his ventures with rigorous standards of perfection that are applied to the slightest of subtleties. Such a mindset translated naturally when Warped expanded into pipe tobaccos in 2019, seeing Kyle Gellis collaborate with Cornell & Diehl's Jeremy Reeves to create nuanced blends, marked by quality components and intriguing flavor profiles that align with Warped's \"be exclusively different\" mantra.\n\nJoining Warped's selection of pipe tobaccos, Gellis and Reeves present Warped's Kings Stride as a regular production mixture. The blend's moniker is taken from one of Kyle's high-end wines, with matching logo. Like the Cabernet Sauvignon, Kings Stride pipe tobacco is rich, poised, and elegant \u2014 a crumble cake boasting a combination of Louisiana Perique, five year-aged Burley, and a unique Cavendish comprised of pressed and steamed cigar leaf, for a natural profile that's free of added flavor to showcase the quality tobaccos' inherent notes.",
