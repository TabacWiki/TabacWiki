        "description": "For many decades this unique blend was one of Drucquer's most popular, and was even known to have comforted members of Admiral Richard Byrd's crew during their second Antarctic expedition. The finely balanced combination of Virginia tobaccos, white and brown burleys, and just a bit of Latakia and perique keeps Inns of Court in high regard. A lighter blend with a complex, nutty taste and wonderful, nostalgic aroma that is sure to suit many palates. Fill your bowl and enjoy a taste of history! - Gregory Pease",
