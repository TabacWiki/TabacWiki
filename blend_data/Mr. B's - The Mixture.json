        "notes": "Notes:This tobacco is part of Mr. B's (Brigham) \"D-Series\", introduced in 2009. Reminiscent of one of the world's top brands, this pipe tobacco is a perfect replacement for an established favourite. If you like the famous Dunhill blends,  you will appreciate the all new Mr. B's D-Series.\n\n\"The Mixture\" is Brigham's offering for Dunhill's \"My Mixture 965\". These were released during a time when Dunhill tobaccos were no longer in production. Due to French Canadian laws, the tobacco tin features both French and English. \"Le Mixture\" is simply \"The Mixture\" in French. Since Dunhill tobaccos had been relaunched by the Scandinavian Tobacco Group, \"The Mixture\" was re-branded under Brigham's own flagship under the name \"Heritage Blend\" as part of their \"Legend\" series.",
