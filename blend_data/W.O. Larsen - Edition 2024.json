        "description": "In celebration of 2024 and 160th anniversary we offer a truly mellow, yet tasty and well-balanced Scandinavian composed blend. The mixture consists in handpicked Virginia and Cavendish from Africa and South America, and Burley from Malawi and Mexico.\n\nThe tobacco has a light burning sensation and is a pleasant smoking experience, because of the sweet and nonchalant, yet firm and distinctive taste. The smoke leaves you with smotth notes of cinnamon, speculoos, and cloves which additionally gives the blend a delicate and graceful room note. The W.O. Larsen 2024 Edition is to be enjoyed with supreme pleasure after a light dinner with a fruity, but dry, cold port. It may also be savored after a light but enriched dessert, perchance with hot chocolate, Irish coffee, or with fruity light beer that quenches the thirst, but leaves you wanting more. The aroma is filled with delight and satisfaction, making it the perfect experience for anyone wanting to add memorable moment of pure enjoyment and amusement.\n\nThis year's edition is dark red, the dark red color symbolizes passion, sophistication and elegance. Whilst the logo and ornaments, in gold, is an expression of the premium quality that W.O. Larsen has produced since 1864. Together, the colour combination, creates a visually striking impression of luxury and exclusiveness.",
