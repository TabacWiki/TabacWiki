        "description": "It was 1904.  Amid a backdrop of prosperity, extraordinary courage and new frontiers, Leonard Dingler arrived in the old Transvaal to join the search for fame and fortune.  He brought not only his passionate sense of adventure, but also the family tradition of fine tobacco making. Little has changed.  The time honoured tobacco blends are still created with the same skill and discernment that was Leonard Dingler's trade mark, then and now.",
