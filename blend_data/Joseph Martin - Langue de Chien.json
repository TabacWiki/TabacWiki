        "description": "Langue de Chien means Tongue of the Dog; according to growers, Semois leaves look like dog tongues. This is Semois tobacco, originally a Kentucky cultivar, which is an air-cured burley-type tobacco, though it deserves to be recognized as a unique leaf. Naturally dry, it should be smoked that way, and packed tightly; fast burning. Joseph Martin is one of the premier growers and makers of Semois tobacco, along with JP Couvert and Vincent Manil.",
        "notes": "Notes:Semois tobacco has been grown since at least 1650 in the micro-clime of the Semois Valley of Belgium. \"Semois\" is not a protected legal term (AOC), thus some tobaccos are inappropriately labeled as Semois.\n\nSince early 2014, Joseph Martin tobaccos have been imported into the U.S. on a small scale.
