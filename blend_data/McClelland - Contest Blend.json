        "description": "McClelland has been asked to provide this blend several times over the years for the slow smoking contest held by pipe clubs. In every instance, contestants have commented on the good taste, pleasant light-up and easy draw. It's a winning blend, even for those who didn't come in first (or is it last?). Why wait for a contest to enjoy this exceptional pipe tobacco blend of matured and stoved Virginias with a very little touch of latakia. It was developed for the long distance pipe smoker, but is enjoyable even in a sprint.",
