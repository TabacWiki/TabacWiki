        "description": "Hickory was another of those \"all-day\" type of over-the-counter blends. It was made of mellow Burley, and had a subtle fruity note. It was enjoyed by many across the US for decades, but it fell victim to the axe a while back. We received enough inquiries about Hickory that we asked Russ Ouellette to do his best to come up with his own version, which we now call MATCH Hickory.",
