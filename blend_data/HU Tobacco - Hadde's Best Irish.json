        "description": "For 30 years now, Hadde has been my friend. He is the communicator in our circle, and that alone demands that his signature tobacco be something special. Hadde loves aromatic blends, so for him I created a medium-strong Broken Flake. Light and medium brown Virginias from Africa, blended with a good measure of Louisiana perique and dark fired Kentucky. An elaborate casing of Irish character gives this blend its special character, always present but never drowning out the tobacco\u2018s superb quality. Hadde\u2018s Best Irish is a temptation for aroma lovers, and for fans of natural tobaccos looking to give themselves a treat.",
