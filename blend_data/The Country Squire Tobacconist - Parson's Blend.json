        "description": "Meet Parson's Blend... developed for the parson himself!  One of our dear customers, who happens to be an Anglican priest, asked for a blend that his wife would let him smoke indoors and that also would not lead to tongue bite.  Parson's Blend is our effort to deliver these characteristics in a mild, aromatic blend that leaves your mouth feeling soft and smooth and fills the room with a delicious, warm note.  Customers often say that Parson's Blend's smoke is \"thick\"; our experience is that it leaves you in the midst of a very pleasant cloud.  Delicious and crowd-pleasing!",
