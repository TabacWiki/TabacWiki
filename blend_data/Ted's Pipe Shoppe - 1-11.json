        "description": "Many of my fatherâ€™s experiments as well as  blends for various customers were lodged and annotated by hand on 3 x 5 index cards kept in a couple of metal boxes.  Occasionally, one would make it from the box onto the counter.  This is one of those and hence the name 1-11 for experiment 1-11.  It is similar to 300 but its further mellowed with additional cube cut burley and Virginia flake.",
