        "notes": "Notes:Pipestud had mentioned the problem McClelland had with this tobacco.  My understanding is that they were NOT forced to stop production; they chose to.  Mike had procured this wonderful organically grown Virginia leaf and planned to tin and sell it as \"organic tobacco,\" which it is.  The problem arose because McClelland had processed it using the same machinery as was used to process non-organic tobacco.  This is a no-no.  No organic product may contain any trace of non-organics.  So, Mike sent this out as organically-GROWN, which it was, but was so disappointed and disgusted with the Federal nit-picking, he decided not to pursue the issue further.",
