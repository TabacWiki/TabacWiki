        "description": "Fine small leaf oriental tobaccos and rich Virginias weave a tapestry of intrigue, serving as an exotic backdrop to showcase the exquisite Syrian Latakia, Bohemian Scandal is a delicious Balkan blend in a style not produced in decades. It has a delightful wine-like character, with a delicate and fascinating spice. Wonderfully balanced, it is excellent in its youth, yet sturdy enough for long aging. Enjoy it now, and be sure to cellar plenty for future adventures.",
        "notes": "Notes:From Gregory Pease website:  Bohemian Scandal was introduced in August, 2004.\n\nNearly a year in the making, this blend, the first in the new Heirloom Series, features some truly magnificent Syrian Latakia, possibly the finest example of this exotic leaf that's been seen in 40 years. When we arranged for its import, and the first samples arrived, I fell quickly and deeply for it; Bohemian Scandal is the love child of our little tryst. The Syrian is wine-like, possessing subtlety and nuances that would be easily lost to a heavy hand at the blending table. I chose bright and red Virginias, and rare oriental tobaccos to compliment the spice of the Latakia; hints of cardamom, nutmeg, cinnamon are present, along with a gentle smokiness. A soft, slightly tangy sweetness continues throughout the bowl, with the complex, earthy notes from the oriental tobaccos providing depth. The flavor is bold enough for casual smoking, but sufficiently refined to be engaging during more contemplative moods. Wonderfully balanced, it is excellent in its youth, yet sturdy enough for long aging. Enjoy it now, and be sure to cellar plenty for future adventures.\n\nIn November, 2004, a warehouse fire consumed our supply of the exquisite vintage Syrian Latakia that was used in Renaissance, Raven's Wing and Mephisto, as well as Bohemian Scandal. These blends have been discontinued, indefinitely.",
