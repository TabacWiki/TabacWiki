        "description": "Time and pressure can work miracles on pipe tobacco and with Latakia-based blends, those impacts can be even more dramatic. Hearth & Home Slow-Aged Knotty Pine starts as a broken flake made of Latakia, Virginia, Orientals, and a touch of Burley for body. Then, the broken flake is re-pressed into a crumble cake, but with a significant twist. The tobacco is placed in a holding press for a month to allow the tobaccos to marry for additional smoothness, and the Virginias continue to mature. This blend has a very noticeable \"old fashioned\" flavor and aroma. If you're a Latakia fan, this is a blend you won't want to miss.",
