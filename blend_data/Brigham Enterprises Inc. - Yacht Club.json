        "notes": "Notes:This tobacco is part of Mr. B's (Brigham) \"D-Series\", introduced in 2009. Reminiscent of one of the world's top brands, this pipe tobacco is a perfect replacement for an established favourite. If you like the famous Dunhill blends,  you will appreciate the all new Mr. B's D-Series.\n\n\"Yacht Club\" is Brigham's offering for Dunhill's \"Royal Yacht\". These were released during a time when Dunhill tobaccos were no longer in production. Due to French Canadian laws, the tobacco tin features both French and English. \"Club De Voile\" is simply \"Yacht Club\" in French. Since Dunhill tobaccos had been relaunched by the Scandinavian Tobacco Group, \"Royal Yacht\" was re-branded under Brigham's own flagship under the name \"Hudson's Bay\" as part of their \"Legend\" series.",
