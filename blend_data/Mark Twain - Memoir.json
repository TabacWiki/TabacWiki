        "description": "When Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known to us as Mark Twain, didn't have a cigar nearby, he had his trusty corn cob pipes, and he made it clear that they were Missouri Meerschaums. Opinions differ as to what he smoked in those pipes, but we think that he would have enjoyed Mark Twain Memoir pipe tobacco. Select, rich Burley is combined with choice, zesty Virginia and aged to perfection. Then the tobaccos are treated to a singular cordial flavor that delivers a mellow sweetness to the taste, and creates a room note that's so enjoyable that you'll want to walk out of the room when you're finished and walk back in so you can take full advantage of the aroma yourself. If you like a smooth aromatic, you're going to love Mark twain Memoir.",
