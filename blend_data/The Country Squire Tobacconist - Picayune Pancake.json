        "description": "Take a step through the garden gate and take delight in a Southern breakfast.\nPicayune Pancake was whipped up in the kitchen with Toasted Cavendish mixed with a variety of Virginias with cased and natural sweetness to combine for a rich but complex smoking experience. Flavorful with a pleasant room note while still kind to the mouth.",
