        "description": "This Christmas, we have decided to revive the first Yuletide tobacco that Bob blended in 1951. This limited-run blend consists of Burley, Virgina, Turkish, and a special and slightly sweet aromatic that gives both body and mildness to the finished mixture. Limited availability. Here's to the master blender, Robert Peretti.",
        "notes": "Notes:Many of you are familiar with something called \u201cYuletide.\u201d It is a concoction that is made yearly, and each iteration is different from the previous year's. This time around, we sought to make something more rooted in our decades old tradition in blending. Bob Peretti made blending a staple at this company, so this time around, our holiday mixture is recreated in observance of his contribution to this company.",
