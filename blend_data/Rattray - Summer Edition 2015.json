        "description": "Rattray's Summer Edition 2015 is a blend of Virginias and black cavendish with a warm breeze of fresh raspberries and peach cream flavour. A perfect accompaniment to any summer's day! The mix of light to medium brown Virginias against a background of dark cavendish gives the impression of a beautiful sunset abreast a backdrop of wispy clouds and a horizon of sky and sea, full of colour and invokes a sense of tranquillity. The aroma coming from the tin is sweet, like a conserve. A picnic blanket laid with cake, jam, buns and fruits upon a grassy hillock scattered with loose hay, overlooking the coast. This is summer at its best!\n\nThe ribbon cut is a pleasure to pack into a pipe and being of optimum humidity, lights with ease. The flavours are immediately released; raspberry, peach and the base tobaccos work fantastically well together. It burns evenly and thoroughly, leaving a fine ash.\n\nIf the weather turns or winter is setting in, take a pinch of this Summer Edition in your pipe to revive those memories of better conditions.",
