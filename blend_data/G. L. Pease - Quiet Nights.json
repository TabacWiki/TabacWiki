        "description": "Rich, deep, contemplative... Ripe red Virginias, fine Orientals, smokey Cyprus latakia, and a pinch of acadian perique are pressed and matured in cakes before being sliced. The sophisticated flavors and exotic aroma provide a wonderful backdrop for quiet moments of reflection, a good book, and if you are so inclined, perhaps a wee dram.",
        "notes": "Notes:This is the second entry in the Old London Series. It is fuller and somewhat more latakia forward than Chelsea Morning, with a higher percentage of Orientals, and less perique. It's rich, complex, leathery and smoky, with a naturally sweet structure from the darker Virginias, and a balanced Oriental spice. It compares in strength and fullness with blends like Samarra and Blackpoint, but the pressing makes it deeper, darker, and brings new dimensions to the flavors and aromas. It's really wonderful. An ideal addition to the series, perfectly complimenting a relaxing evening.\n\nQuiet Nights was introduced in May, 2010.",
