        "notes": "Notes:At the time the E&C range was being developed, many of the mixtures which had established London's well earned position of dominance, were no longer being made. One such blend was Freibourg & Treyer's Golden Mixture which was a Virginia in the truest sense and was composed of all ribbon cut Virginias of lovely golden color. McConnell's had manufactured this blend for the F&T shop in London for many years, but for some reason it was no longer being sold by them. Ken believed this particular mixture was among the finest of its type, thus the decision to add it to the E&C range. Its name comes from the city in southern Virginia, which is well associated with tobacco.\n\nInformation from \"The E&C Story\" on the Marble Arch Ltd. website: http://www.serjacopo.com/e%26c/E%26C_000.html",
