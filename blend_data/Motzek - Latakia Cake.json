        "description": "What a cake! Scent of hop, malt, tart-spicy leatheriness, delicate sweetness. Characterful Virginias, fully-matured latakia (20%), supplemented and rounded by nutty burley, aromatic perique, some black cavendish and a pinch of Orientals. Pressed and matured the flavors melt into a smokers delight!",
        "notes": "Notes:The TAK Latakia Cake deserves its name. When opening the bag comes to the clear smell of smoky latakia countered, accompanied by something which is probably the most accurate with \"hopfig, malty\".\n\nAs the name says, the tobacco is pressed under high pressure and added heat to a cake. Before, cut tobacco (no whole tobacco leaves) is tuned and mixed with each other. This results in a much looser consistency than a plug, which makes it much easier to use. Nevertheless, pressing is a miraculous process, and this results in a very harmonious result.\n\nIt consists of a neat portion of Virginia, and an equally orderly portion of latakia. Add to this our characteristic perique, a bit natural burley, and to round it off, a little of pinch black cavendish and Oriental.\n\nTo make the tobacco \"ready to smoke\" it is enough to loosen it between the fingers. If you want, you can also get your plug-knife to cut the tobacco from the block.",
