        "description": "Made by spinning tobacco dark fired leaves into a rope. This is more widely used as a chewing tobacco, although can still be smoked if preferred. The pouch aroma is both oily and spicy due to the diameter of the twist, usually cut into so many little discs in order to chew or smoke. Once you cut them, you see a very deep reddish brown colour, especially under direct light. It is truly a strong tobacco. The taste settles down gradually and becomes increasingly sweet, spicy, and creamy. Flavored with peaches.\n\nSweet Peach Twist - The main feature of this tobacco is the addition of inverted sugars and peach to the 'filter' leaf. This is then spun into a rope form before being made into a roll which is cold-pressed overnight",
