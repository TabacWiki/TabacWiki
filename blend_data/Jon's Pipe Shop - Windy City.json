        "notes": "Notes:From Pat Callaghan, the blender: Windy City is a mixture I developed many, many, years ago for a customer who wanted something to replace an IRC tobacco he used to get in Chicago.  I came up with one and named it 'Windy City' in honor of the city where he'd found the tobacco he had first loved.  That blend has been a success for us ever since...although the mixture has 'evolved' over time as the ingredient tobaccos have had to change with the changes in availabilities over the last 40+ years. We still mix Windy City by hand in the same metal tub.",
