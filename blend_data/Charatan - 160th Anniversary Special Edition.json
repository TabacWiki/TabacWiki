        "notes": "Notes:Oliver Kopp (Managing Director of Kopp Companies) explains the new discovery and the continuation of the brand as follows: \"The sonorous name 'Charatan' threatened to disappear more and more over the years before our Scottish friends from Tor Imports took it on in 2017 and helped 'Charatan' to flourish again. Together with the master blenders from Tor Imports, we have created, tasted and discarded many mixtures. It had to be a mixture that did justice to the big name. Traditional and yet with a modern touch. It took a while, but in the end we found the perfect mixing ratio: Golden brown Burley, nutty as you could only wish for, accompanied by a large proportion of naturally sweet Virginia. This gentle, creamy melange is completed by a portion of Black Cavendish, which excellently transports an aroma of plum, vanilla and a hint of mirabelle. The tobacco aromas are never overshadowed by the aroma. It's just a hint that ensnares the palate a little with every puff and also provides an excellent spatial note. Different types of cuts provide a cool smoking pleasure. The Scottish national animal stands for Scotland's long history shrouded in legends and myths. Nothing fits better than crests for one of the oldest pipe brands in the world.\"",
