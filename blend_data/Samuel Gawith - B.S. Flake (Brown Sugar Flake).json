        "description": "A Samuel Gawith/The Danish Pipe Shop pipe tobacco called Brown Sugar Flake. Due to new EU laws the name was changed in 2017 from Brown Sugar Flake to B. S. Flake. The main goal was to relive the famous Orlik Brown Sliced, but in a more full style (not strong but more body). It's matured high quality Virginia that is hot pressed with some natural cavendish. So you get a pure flavour with a hint of natural sweetness from the cavendish. To spice it up it has a pinch of burley and Oriental.",
        "notes": "Notes:Was launched as Brown Sugar Flake but in 2017 the name had to change due to new EU laws where a word like \"sugar\" may not be used on a tobacco related product. The new name is B. S. Flake.",
