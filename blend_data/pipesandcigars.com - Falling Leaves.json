        "description": "When the weather turns cool and the foliage turns, many pipe smokers turn to Latakia blends.  But for some, a lot of those blends are too heavy, deep, and smoky. For those people, we're glad to bring you Russ' Falling Leaves. This is what some call an American English, since it contains some mellow burley along with the usual cast of players: sweet Virginias, fragrant Orientals, and, of course, rich Cyprian Latakia. The result is a mellow to medium-bodied blend that has the \"campfire\" smokiness but without being too heavy. For anyone who wants an all day type of Latakia blend, you'll want to try Russ' Falling Leaves.",
