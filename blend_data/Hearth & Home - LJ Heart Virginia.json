        "description": "Lannes Johnson makes some of the coolest and driest smoking pipes around, but he's as particular about tobacco as he is about his craftsmanship. When he wanted a Virginia tobacco blend to send as a sample to his pipe customers, he had a certain idea in mind. So we considered it a real challenge to develop this mixture. It had to be sweet, but not too much. It had to have a little tang, but without sharpness or bite, and it needed to smoke coolly. To this end, we combined 3 different types of red Virginia with a whisper of St. James perique to get your \"heart\" started.",
