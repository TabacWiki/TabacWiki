        "notes": "Notes:Blended by Mac Baren in the early 80s for their distributor Fireside, and seems to have been a short-lived product.  There was also an aromatic produced, which I have heard tasted very similar.  This is very much like Burley London Blend, with perhaps a bit more Virginia.  The 7 ounce tin came with a non-sealing screw top and a sealed plastic bag inside, but has held up well and is quite smokeable.  It is not as good as the aged roll cakes, and though not technically branded Mac Baren but Fireside, it is as much a Mac Baren as any other Mac Baren, and a rare curiosity to fans of the brand.",
