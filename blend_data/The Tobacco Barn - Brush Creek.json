        "description": "This English mixture is considered \"our special English mixture\".  It has everything but the kitchen sink! \n\nA combination of a light aromatic blend and a traditional English, Virginias, burley, toasted cavendish, fire cured vanilla base cavendish and a fair amount of Latakia. You might notice small specks of a greenish substance in this blend. This is not tobacco, rather it is a herb referred to as \"deer tongue.\" While it is neutral in taste, it was used in many old time tobacco blends to bring about a nicer aroma of the pipe. We use a small amount in the Brush Creek blend to mask the more pungent aroma of the Latakia in this fine blend.",
