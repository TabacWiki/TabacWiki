        "description": "Paul Revere's famous midnight ride is commemorated in this luxurious blend. Virginia grades from three of the finest growing regions are combined with         Oriental tobacco, Cyprian latakia, and a touch of perique. A relaxing, cool, and medium bodied smoke perfect for quiet, reflective moments.",
        "notes": "Notes:As with most of the \"American Heritage\" blends by CAO, this one has been discontinued by CAO but is still being offered by original blenders Dan Tobacco (DTM).\n\nTrivia: The date of the ride was April 18th, 1775, and is celebrated by many Americans. A key feature of Revere's ride had to do with the lantern signal given at at Old North Church announcing the enemy's arrival; “One if by land; two if by sea.”  The church deacons hung two, and off rode Revere to apprise the other Sons OF Liberty.",
