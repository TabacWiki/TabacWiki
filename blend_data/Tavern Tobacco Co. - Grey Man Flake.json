        "description": "The story of the Grey Man of Pawley's Island is one of the best known and most enduring tales of the South Carolina Low Country. No one is certain who the Grey Man was in life, but all agree that those who encounter his spirit wandering the beach of Pawleys should pay heed since he's always the harbinger of a huge storm. Like the Gray Man himself, the Grey Man Port O' Call is no more; once a favorite watering hole, a huge blow years ago left it nothing but a memory. But like the Grey Man, there are those who say the Port O' Call is still lively on certain nights and if the wind is just right, you can hear the laughter and toasts being made and catch the faint aroma of the house tobacco wafting over the dunes.",
