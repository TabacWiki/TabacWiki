        "description": "Originally, this blend was a custom blend for a customer of Steve's back in 1985, under the name \"Stumpy Gump\", which later was renamed \"Renaissance\".  It is a full Scottish Mixture, lightly and naturally sweet, consisting of:  48% Cyprian Latakia, aged Old Belt Red Burley & Malayan Red Burley, 5 Turkish Varietals, Red and Bright Lemon Virginias, with White Burley.  Steve has brought this blend back, after 5 years, now that all of the blend components are available.",
