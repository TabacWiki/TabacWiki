        "description": "The first of our Aromatic Latakia Series, a classic North American style of black cavendish and Virginia aromatic, but with the added richness of latakia. Initially, the concept seems a little odd; latakia is something you associate with English/Oriental/Balkan blends, sweet and sticky aromatics are the last place you would expect to find this smoke cured Cypriot leaf.\n\nLatakia is a very smooth and cool burning tobacco; it has lots of flavour and is low in nicotine. The cool and smooth qualities really enhance the often hot aromatics by slowing down the burn rate and cooling the smoke. The sweetness from the casings and toppings give the Latakia a smoky flavour and a sweet and fragrant backdrop.",
