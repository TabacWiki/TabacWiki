        "description": "What place are you in? There is an unmistakable smell of caramel, popcorn and carousels. The music sounds loud and merry, different at every corner. Carnies call out to you to spend their coins with you. They promise amusement, joy and blowing hair in exchange. Horses neigh, clowns trip over their feet, children laugh. The artist's sweet, lemony-fruity perfume drifts over to you. We are in Blackpool, the circus, fairground and entertainment center of northern England. These impressions and smells are quintessentially captured in this tobacco. Broken Virginia, Black Cavendish, creamy honey notes, popcorn aroma and caramel extracts take you to this place of pleasure.",
