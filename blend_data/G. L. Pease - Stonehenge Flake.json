        "description": "From Gregory Pease: In 2001, I had the honor and pleasure of collaborating with G.H. & Co.'s John Gawith on a very special tobacco, and after nearly a year of development, Stonehenge Flake, a modern VA/Perique blend steeped in English tradition, was born. \n\nFine Virginias are layered with Louisiana Perique, and just a touch of Burley for added body and a fuller flavor, then steamed, hot-pressed, and matured. The cakes are thinly sliced and tinned, ready for your smoking pleasure \u2014 today, and for many years to come.",
        "notes": "Notes:Stonehenge Flake was produced in December 2001 in a very limited edition of approximately 1500 2oz tins.\n\nPrevious notes: Stonehenge Flake is a wonderful traditional flake comprised of bright flue-cured and sun-cured leaf from Brazil, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, with just a touch of Malawi Burley added for a bit of body, and a slightly fuller flavor. Then, we added a hint of genuine St. James Parish Perique, for its special piquant contribution. Once blended, the leaf was steamed, hot-pressed into blocks, and aged, to allow the flavors to meld and marry. The mature blocks were sliced into thin flakes, and cut into 2\" lengths. This blend was a special limited release and is no longer made.\n\nStonehenge was re-released into production in Friday, 23rd June 2017. The re-released edition is manufactured by the precise formula and protocol John Gawith and Gregory Pease developed in 2001. \n\nIn the end of 2022 this issue has been discontinued.",
