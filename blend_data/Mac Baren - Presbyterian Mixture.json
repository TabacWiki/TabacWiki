        "notes": "Notes:This fine tobacco originally had no name. It was blended before the first World War especially for the Very Rev. Dr. John White, sometime minister of the Barony Kirk in Glasgow and Moderator of the General Assembly in Scotland in 1929. He introduced it to Stanley Baldwin, later Earl Baldwin, Prime Minister in 1923, 1924 and 1935.  He liked it so much that regular supplies were sent  down to him and it was he who suggested that it be called \"Presbyterian Mixture\". As there continues to be controversy over the question of whether Presbyterian Mixture contains latakia, the following quote from page six of the blender's 2008 catalogue should leave the matter settled: \"Extraordinarily soft blend of finest US Virginia grades and a number of selected latakia leaf tips. Ideal mixture also for beginners with English tobaccos.\" Originally blended for mass market by William P. Solomon, whose recipe it still follows.\n\nThe \"International\" version is called \"Melange\".\n\nCurrently made by Mac Baren.",
