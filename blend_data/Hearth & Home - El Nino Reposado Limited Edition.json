        "description": "Reposado is a new approach. This blend of toasty red Virginia and Perique is enhanced by a bit of unflavored Black Cavendish, dark-fired Kentuckey, and a whisper of Latakia. The blend is then aged in a tequila barrel to imbue the tobacco with a synergistic aroma.",
        "notes": "Notes:Russ Ouellette. the creator of the Hearth & Home Marquee Series loves to pick apart flavors and he noticed when trying an aged tequila that it had a subtle hint of tobacco flavor. That got him thinking about what we could do with that revelation. When we were able to get our hands on a recently decanted tequila barrel, he produced a plan. He took one of the more nuanced Marquee blends, El NiÃ±o, and had it packed in the barrel to steep in the essence of the spirit. Now we have an already flavorful blend that's enhanced by tequila flavor without having to add any liquor to the blend. It's subtle, a little tangy, a little sweet, and a real treat for people who prefer blends that are \"outside the box.\" This run was limited to less than 1800 tins, so pick some up before they sell out!",
