        "description": "The Bengal Slices family continues to grow, this time with a limited-edition blend with a very special and unique story behind it. The folks behind the brand were told about the availability of a fresh, empty bourbon barrel from the best-known single-barrel brand on the market. We can't tell you the name, but we'll tell you that it's also known for its collection of racehorse bottle stoppers. They selected a special tobacco blend with a more modest amount of Latakia, so the infusion of bourbon flavor would be clearly noticeable. The tobacco was laid to rest in the barrel for a full month to allow the infusion of buttery-smooth bourbon flavor to take hold. Then the tobacco was pressed into a crumble cake to further embed the flavor into the leaf.\n\nSince the barrel can only be used once since the essence of the premium bourbon evaporates fairly quickly, they were limited to a relatively small number of tins that could be produced. The result is a very different blend with a mellow English blend flavor supported by the gentle infusion of caramelly bourbon flavor.  Be sure to act quickly. These won't last long.",
