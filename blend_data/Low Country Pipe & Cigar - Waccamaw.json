        "description": "The Waccamaw River meanders through the eastern Carolinas, part of the Pee Dee River basin, a region intertwined with the history of tobacco for three centuries. What finer homage to this heritage than a rich, hearty Virginia flake? Bright leaf serving as the base is typical of the tobaccos grown in this region, while beautiful red Virginias lend it sweetness and structure. Perique and a dash of exotic Izmir leaf complete this complex, satisfying flake.",
        "notes": "Notes:Named for the Native American tribe and part of the Pee Dee River Basin, the Waccamaw River begins in North Carolina and flows southwest into South Carolina before entering Winyah Bay near Georgetown. It offers extensive wetlands for local wildlife and has become an iconic symbol for Horry County, where Smokingpipes and Low Country Pipe and Cigar are located.",
