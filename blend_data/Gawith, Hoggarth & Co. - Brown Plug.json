(u/s - stands for unscented) 83.5% blended Virginias are combined with a relatively high (for English Blends at any rate) proportion of Malawi burley, 12.5%, to give flavour and depth to the smoke, and the addition of just 4% Malawi dark fired leaf is sufficient to combat the typical sharpness of the Virginia leaf resulting in a rounded medium strength smoke.",
