        "description": "Our first \u201cKrumble Kake\u201d tobacco, made using some of the strongest pipe tobaccos we can find. The choice leaves are moistened using distilled water and cold pressed for over 10 days, to create a form of plug. Due to the crazy taxation and restrictions on tobaccos, we can only obtain pre-cut leaf. So all of our kakes are made using course cut tobaccos, the beauty is in a plug that needs no cutting, just a light rub before use. Our BurPer (burley & perique) Kake is made from a heavy base of strong savoury new world burley. A touch of gold and mahogany Virginias to add a little nutty and sweet tinge. Then comes the perique and in GQ Blends traditions, over 25% is made use of. The resulting tobacco is very strong and spicy, with underlying vinegar-like flavour. As the blends stands it\u2019s a little too dry and spicy so a maple topping is added to some of the gold leaf Virginias. \n\nThe resulting tobacco is a tale of two halves. At the start it\u2019s spicy and sweet, but once the smoker is half way through the bowl the sweetness fades and the full power of the burley and perique really come through. Not a blend, we suggest, to anyone who enjoys mild/medium sweet blends; think of a dry sherry mixed with cask strength whisky. A \u201cperique powerhouse\u201d. Forget VaPer (Virginia & perique), and welcome the complex flavours of our first BurPer blend.",
