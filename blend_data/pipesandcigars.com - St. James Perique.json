        "description": "This is the big bonus in the Golden Triangle Series. Straight St. James Perique hasn’t been available to the public in many years. What is in the tin is 50 grams of 100% true St. James Perique, which is a combination of the four varietal types included in this series. Now you can add some of this very rare tobacco to your favorite blend, make a whole new mixture, or if you’re feeling spunky, you can try it straight. In any case, it’s something you won’t see anywhere else.",
        "notes": "Notes:The Golden Triangle Series of pipe tobaccos is a showcase for some very rare versions of St. James Perique. Mark Ryan, of L.A. Poche Perique Company decided one year to put up a barrel of Perique from each of the four growing regions of St. James' Golden Triangle, rather than mixing them together for processing. This experiment created four distinctly different versions of Perique. In the Golden Triangle Series, Russ Ouellette has created a base blend that is used in the four regional mixtures that allows you to be able to see the difference in the flavor of the singular Perique varietals. To round out the series, Mark has allowed us to offer a tin of straight St. James Perique (as opposed to the usual Acadian Perique), the first time that pure St. James has been offered to the public in many years.",
