        "notes": "Notes:Fine Then (!) was created for the recording of the Country Squire Podcast's 500th and last espisode on March 4th, 2023. There was a running joke on the Country Squire Podcast that pipe tobaccos smelled like raisins. As a Doctor of Pipes & certified tobacconist, Jon David Cole would always correct Beau York by telling him a raisin tobacco has never existed (to his knowledge). \n\nNow it does.",
