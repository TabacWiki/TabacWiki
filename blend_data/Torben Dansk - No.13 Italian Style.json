        "description": "The gentle mixture with the discreet, friendly and sweet coffee aroma. These fine sweet mixture Virginia combines several types of different cutting width with a lot of brown burley, the best harmonizes with the coffee aroma and that a \"chocolate\" accent adds. A perfectly matched share of velvety black cavendish makes the taste of this mix to the full and aromatic, without letting it become too heavy. Slowly smoldering smoke and therefore cool. Our special recommendation for demanding pipe smoker, put on a good note value space (have to).",
