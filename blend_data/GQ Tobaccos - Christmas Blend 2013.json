        "description": "Unlike most sweet aromatics which are usually released by the big blenders for Christmas, our own blend is a little more complex. This blend is created using some traditional Christmas flavours of fruits and spices with a good dash of whisky to produce a stunning room note and flavours. The base tobacco is robust, thanks to the use of brown twist, which gives the tobacco a solid base. The addition of North American cavendish, African Virginia and a touch of burley make this a smooth and medium bodied smoke. No Christmas blend is complete without the addition of festive flavours and ours is very similar. Topped off with cinnamon, nutmeg, honey, apple and clove, gives this tobacco a flavour which is a cross between mulled wine and apple strudel. We must not forget the addition of the whisky which is infused to provide a little sweetness and an even warmer edge to the aroma.",
