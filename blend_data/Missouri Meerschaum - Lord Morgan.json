        "description": "Tin states, \"This Special Edition blend is no ordinary English, it is a delectable mixture of 65% Cyprian Latakia, carried aloft by Oriental, Virginia, Burley tobaccos and a dash of Perique. If this was not enough to stimulate the palate, then surely knowing that this tobacco was aged in a top shelf bourbon barrel for 9 months, then pressed into a Crumble Kake, should be enough to send you over the edge. This is the preferred smoke of lords.\" \n\nLimited Edition for 2022 only 2000 tins were made.",
        "notes": "Notes:Smoking pipes says, \"A tribute to Missouri Meerschaum's General Manager and tobacco aficionado Phil Morgan, Lord Morgan is a special collaboration blend between the world's oldest corn cob pipe factory and Sutliff. A complex and surprisingly potent English blend, Lord Morgan combines 65% Cypriot Latakia with select Orientals, Virginias, burleys, and a dash of perique, and the mixture is aged for nine months in top-shelf bourbon barrels before being pressed into the dense cakes that have made Sutliff's Crumble Kake series so popular.\"",
