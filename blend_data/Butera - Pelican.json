        "description": "The second, after Kingfisher, in this special series of pipe tobaccos especially formulated to the specific priorities of Michael A. Butera. Simply, Pelican is the perfect Mixture, combining exact portions of the finest, most rare Cyprian Latakia, the spiciest, most zesty Turkish and Orientals, and the richest, most sweet sun grown Virginia whole leaf available today. Aged in cakes then fine cut to ribbon form. Pelican delivers multiple dimensions of sweet, mellow tastes, with a variety of contradicting rich and spicy room aromas. Return in time to those days and nights long since forgotten, when only the finest English Oriental style Mixtures would satisfy you.",
        "notes": "Notes:According to Michael Butera, Pelican was originally blended by Peter Stokkebye in Denmark before production later moved to J.F. Germain in th UK. 21 October 2016 Update: J.F. Germain appears to have resumed production of this blend.\n\nBlend type is English/Oriental.",
