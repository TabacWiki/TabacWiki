        "description": "A sophisticated, traditional American style blend! Red and lemon Virginias are blended in perfect measure with mild brown and unflavored black cavendish tobaccos, and a bit of fine, high grade burley leaf for just a little extra body. The blend is then delicately kissed with a subtle and intriguing flavor, enhancing the natural sweetness of the Virginias and providing a delightful, light room aroma.",
        "notes": "Notes:From SmokingPipes: Fans of Virginia/burley blends will surely love this unsung blend, comprised of red and bright Virginias, dark and white burley, and a touch of unsweetened black cavendish. Easy to pack and light, this smooth sailing smoke offers up layer upon layer of naturally sweet VA flavor balanced with creamy chocolate notes from the burleys, and all enhanced with a lovely topping of plum, rum, and maple. The topping is understated, and works well to accentuate the depth and complexity of the tobaccos used. Created by Greg Pease and the late Craig Tarler, the two friends of \"Two Friends Pipe Tobacco,\" this blend was Craig's every day smoke for years.",
