        "description": "The exquisite Kentucky Club pipe tobacco consists of carefully selected and blended tobaccos. Virginia from Carolina and Georgia, as well as burley from Tennessee, rounded with black cavendish. Characteristic aroma of hazelnuts and coffee. A mild pipe tobacco with various cut tobaccos, perfectly conditioned. Due to its good smoke characteristics and the natural and digestible taste, as well as the pleasant room note, this high class tobacco is both for the new and experienced pipe smoker. The full-bodied Kentucky Club pipe tobacco in its 100 gram bag spoils the smoker with a spicy aromatictaste and offers a mellow smoking pleasure.",
