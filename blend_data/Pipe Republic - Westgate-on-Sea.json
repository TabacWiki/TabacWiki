        "description": "Westgate-on-Sea is a charming little village bordering the famous seaside resort of Margate as well as the village of Birchington-on-Sea. It is located in the far southeast of England, on the Thanet Peninsula in Kent.\n\nThe predominantly mild climate, however, is always marred by its exposed location and proximity to the North Sea. Thus, as a resident, one must be quite accustomed to a \"stiff breeze\" and a lot of salty air.  \n\nWith so much \"sea aroma\" in the air, a tobacco may also like to be stronger in aroma. A Dark Fired tobacco, namely Kentucky, is best suited for this. This, together with a small portion of Virginia for better burning, is hot pressed for some time in flake presses. The process is quite complex, because a lot of steam has to be generated. However, it mellows the tobacco, takes away its pungency and leads to a \"maturing process in fast motion\". This process was still very common in the United Kingdom a few decades ago, but today it is the absolute exception.\n\nThe tobacco is loosened, dries, matures and is packed in 100g tins. When smoked, it has a very intense taste. Spicy, smoky, but at the same time not strong.\n\nPerfect for a walk by the sea, an autumn day in the woods, an end of the day around the campfire.",
