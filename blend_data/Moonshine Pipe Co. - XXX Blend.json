To finish off the exotic mix of tobaccos a light top note of Kentucky Bourbon is added for room note.  XXX is a fantastic English-style blend that will impress you from first light to final puff.",
        "notes": "Notes:Moonshine Pipe Co. has paired up with Pipes and Cigars to bring you an unusual blend that fits the unusual flair that Jonathan Lavezzo puts into his pipes.  Jonathan has built a fast growing pipe brand that was designed to get the blue collar guy a quality pipe they can afford. Getting your hands on one might take time but now you can at least get your hands on the tobacco that complements the brand so well.",
