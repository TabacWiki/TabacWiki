Delicate accompaniments of genuine St. James Perique, light smoked Kentuckey, and exotic Kasturi leaf combine to create a rich and elegant flavor with notes of sweet fruit, citrus, warming spices, and woodsy undertones.\n\nEach 16oz crumble cake comes packaged in a vacuum-sealed bag nestled within a custom-designed gift box. Further elevating its elegant presentation, each brick also includes a reusable vinyl sticker that you can use to label your glass Mason jars.",
