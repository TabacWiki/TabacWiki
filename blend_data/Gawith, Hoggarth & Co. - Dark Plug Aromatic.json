        "description": "Equal proportions of Dark Fired Malawi and Indian dark air cured leaves have been cooked under pressure before undergoing a long curing process and being top dressed with a spicy aromatic flavour. The result is a strong full bodied smoke, which boasts plenty of character. The sweet yet earthy flavour from the Indian leaf contrasting with the smokey peaty flavours of the Dark Fired leaf is one to be experienced. We would however only recommend this for the experienced or adventurous smoker. This is the same tobacco as the unscented Dark Plug with an aromatic top dressing for those lovers of aromatics.",
