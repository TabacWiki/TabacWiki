        "description": "\"Marley's Deep Reserve\"\nAs the legend goes every time Jacob Marley successfully closed another deal, he would sit back in his favorite leather chair and smoke his favorite blend. The recipe for it was never found after he died, but his partner Ebenezer Scrooge noted that the blend smelled considerably of Latakia, cherries and chocolate. He was also very fond of it, if for no other reason than the quiet similarity to chocolate cherry cordials.\n\nMarley's Deep Reserve is the Christmas release for 2024. In an attempt to reproduce that legendary blend Burley and Cavendish from 2016 have been blended with a reasonable portion of Latakia from 2018. These are complimented with a light topping of Maraschino cherry, cocoa and vanilla. The result is a decadent smoke having a room note reminiscent of chocolate cherry cordials with a smokey twist. A tasty and relaxing Christmas baccy for the holiday puffer in us all.",
