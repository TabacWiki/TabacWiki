        "notes": "Notes:The description from 4noggins: Dunhill MM965? This fine hand blended pipe tobacco has been approved by the members of the Pipe Club of London. If you believe the late Bill Ashton-Taylor, at a meeting of the Pipe Club of London, who exclaimed, \"That's it!\", you no longer need to look about. It's as rich as MM965 but all who smoke it say it's so much smoother. You can taste Virginias and latakia equally. No sharpness to it. Just light 'er up and enjoy the sunset with a bowl of this exceptional English blend.",
