        "description": "Bing Crosby had what many consider to be the best male voice in history - and he smoked a pipe! This cut cubed burley and deer tongue (it's a plant fellas) is an authentic copy from one of Bing's close friends, who blended it with him! It probably won't transform your voice to sing like Bing, but it will reward you with the pleasant aroma a good old fashioned tobacco has to offer.",
