Your first instinct is to hit that delete button like a prom date. it's kind of  like that two year old carton of milk in the fridge...you know it's sour, but you just have an insatiable urge to smell it anyways.\n\nWell, I replied and I'm here to tell you that the milk is indeed sour, but the milk man is also a phenomenal blender! Ken Byron is a stand up guy whose blends I love. When I suggested a joint venture he immediately came up with the idea of \"Watch City Ventures\", A  limited run of tobacco where Watch City offers a version of one of his blends and Ken Byron Ventures offers a version of one of ours.\n\nThis is my interpretation of KBV Burlier Morning Pipe. I took the liberty of adding subtle flavors of molasses and anise to the heady coffee flavoring. An imperceptible-in-taste amount of Latakia cools the blend of toasted crumb cut burley and black cavendish, and a dash of bright Virginia adds a subtle floral sweetness.\n\nNow Head over to Ken Byron Ventures and grab some of his \"Crumb Fu!\"...a spectacular take on our Deluxe Crumb Cut.",
