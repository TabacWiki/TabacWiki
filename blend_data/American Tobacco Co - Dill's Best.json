Not much information about the actual blend is known, but it did come in a wide variety of packaging and cuts. It has been called either a straight Virginia blend or consisting of \"pure cigar leaf\". Having been bought out by the American Tobacco Company, production stopped in the 50s when pipe smoking saw a decline and the product no longer sold as well as it once had. The brand does live on in it's line of pipe cleaners, still widely available almost anywhere pipe tobacco products are sold. Image courtesy of marybethhale on Etsy.",
