        "description": "Old-timers might remember the largest supplier of goods for \"outdoorsmen, trappers, and explorers.\" Yes, Herter's, Inc. of Waseca, Minnesota supplied frontier types with the highest quality materials. Even though Herter's had dozens of different kinds of traps, snowshoes, and even smoking pipes to sell, they had only one brand of tobacco. George Herter sincerely felt that with his blend \"Grizzly Bear\" he had achieved perfection, and all other blends were inferior. As a youth I   could hardly wait for my pouch to arrive at the Post Office. Unfortunately. Herter's grandsons bankrupted the old company in the early 1970's and this great blend was no more. In the spirit of Herter's, this mixture is an attempt to again offer this delight. Exotic tobaccos are used, and similar to the original, cured with Angostura aromatic bitters and humidified with Bitter-root apple slices.  This hardy mixture will appeal to mature outdoorsmen/explorers and not to the fainthearted.",
