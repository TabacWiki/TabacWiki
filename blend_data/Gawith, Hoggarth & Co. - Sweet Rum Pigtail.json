        "description": "Manufactured by spinning tobacco dark fired leaves into a rope. The Pig Tail is more widely used as a chewing tobacco although can still be smoked if preferred.\n\nThe pouch aroma is both oily and spicy. Due to the tiny diameter of the twist, usually cut into so many little discs in order to chew or smoke. \n\nOnce you cut them you see a very deep reddish brown colour, especially under direct light. It is truly a strong tobacco. The taste settles down gradually and becomes increasingly sweet, spicy, and creamy. \n\nFlavored with Rum.",
