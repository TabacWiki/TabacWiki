        "description": "The Bayou Dog can find the perique whether it's hidden in a cask at the back of the shed or mixed in with the rich matured Virginia, exotic Turkish, and dark, fragrant Cyprian Latakia tobaccos in this blend. Developed to commemorate Jack's Tobacco's 14th Anniversary, Bayou Dog is smooth, well-balanced, and rich in flavor and aroma. The perique comes out at the first light and stays throughout the bowl, with a finish that will bring the Bayou Dog to sit contentedly at your side to savor his favorite scent. If you can't find the perique in the first bowl, you'll just have to have another.",
