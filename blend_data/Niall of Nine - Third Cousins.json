LOL When I found a sealed box of Kind Edward cigarillos from the 1960's, I smoked a few and they gave me inspiration. My gut said, \"Chop them up and blend them with aged pipe tobacco.\" So that's what I did, and the result is this one of a kind blend that no other human on earth will make for you. Only have 18 jars to go around so get it while it's hot.  \u2014\n\nAged 2 years after blending",
