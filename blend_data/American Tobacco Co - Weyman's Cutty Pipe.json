Cutty Pipe is manufactured from selected burley leaf--the best that Kentucky grows. It is prepared by a new process--in a modern, sanitary factory--and is absolutely free from impurity. There is no purer, milder, better tobacco sold anywhere, at any price. When you get Cutty Pipe you get the best.\"\n\nOriginally created and produced by Weyman & Bros. Tobacco, it was bought by The American Tobacco Company in 1905.",
