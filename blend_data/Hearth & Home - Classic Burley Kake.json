        "description": "Classic Burley Kake is a new blend that pays homage to old time burley flakes and cakes. Using Tennessee and Kentucky burleys, ranging from lighter white to darker mahogany, and a bit of matured red Virginia, this sliced cake tobacco is a traditional American style blend. We start with four different types of burley, the aforementioned Tennessee and Kentucky, plus two different premium white burleys. Then we add a red Virginia for a maple-like sweetness. Then we use all natural flavors: cocoa, rum and anise and steam the tobaccos with the flavorings and firmly press and slice it. The aroma is mellow and pleasant, and the taste is lightly sweet with a large volume of smoke. Hearken back to a simpler time when the sight of a pipe in someone's mouth while walking down the street was common, and the scent of pipe tobacco was everywhere.",
