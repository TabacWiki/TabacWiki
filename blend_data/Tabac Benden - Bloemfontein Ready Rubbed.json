        "description": "Our Bloemfontein Navy Cut is probably already familiar to many. The classic Virginia flake has built up a solid fan base within a very short time. But you are not yet familiar with our new Bloemfontein Ready Rubbed, which has the same tobacco base as the Navy Cut, but tastes completely different. It is much less \u2018uniform\u2019 in flavour than the Navy Cut and offers more highs and lows as the smoke progresses. Apart from that, it burns in an uncomplicated, clean and dry way. All in all, the Bloemfontein Ready Rubbed is a solid, medium-bodied Virginia with an interesting depth of flavour and complexity. Try this future classic.",
