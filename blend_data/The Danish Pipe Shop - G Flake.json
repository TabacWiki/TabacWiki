        "notes": "Notes:G Flake comes from an idea created when The Danish Pipe Shop presented VV92 in 2016 where they used grappa in a pipe tobacco for the first time. Nikolaj Nielsen \u2013 CEO of The Danish Pipe Shop \u2013 is a big fan of Italian grappa and this passion created the idea of VV92 and now G Flake. G Flake is top quality matured Virginia tobacco sprayed with real Italian dark aged grappa and then tinned. The woody taste of grappa combined with alcohol, natural sugar and Virginia makes a perfect match. The Virginia flake is equivalent to My Own Blend number 45 and 333. This is a perfect tobacco to smoke right away, but also for cellaring.\n\n50th anniversary pipe tobacco from The Danish Pipe Shop! After several successful house blends like Mr. Nielsen, Mrs. Nielsen, Brown Plug, River Plug, VV92, Beginner\u2019s Luck and B. S. Flake The Danish Pipe Shop present a new unique house blend called G Flake to celebrate their 50th anniversary in 2019.",
