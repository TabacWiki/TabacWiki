        "notes": "Notes:Known for their boutique, Cuban style cigars, Warped is curated and supervised by founder Kyle Gellis, an entrepreneur and lover of all things bespoke and luxurious. He has a taste for finery and approaches his ventures with rigorous standards of perfection that are applied to the slightest of subtleties. Such a mindset translated naturally when Warped expanded into pipe tobaccos in 2019, seeing Kyle Gellis collaborate with Cornell & Diehl's Jeremy Reeves to create nuanced blends, marked by quality components and intriguing flavor profiles that align with Warped's \"be exclusively different\" mantra.\n\nCloud Hopper, another creation by Gellis and Reeves, now joins Warped's selection of pipe tobaccos as a regular production blend. It takes its name from Warped's Cloud Hopper cigars, which Kyle made with his brother to celebrate their shared love for travel. Cloud Hopper pipe tobacco features AA-grade Dominican Criollo cigar leaf (the same varietal used in The Haunting), married to traditional Italian air-cured tobaccos, yellow and red Virginias, and perique pressed and cut into flakes. The blend transports pipe smokers to an adventurous flavor profile of complex notes of earth, spice, and citrus, while hints of cream and coffee offer comfort along the road. It's a mixture free of added flavors, meant to showcase the natural profile of quality tobaccos.",
