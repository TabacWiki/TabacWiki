        "notes": "Notes:Frederick Charatan established his business in 1863 in London and it remained in the hands of the Charatan family until the 1960ies. Later it became owned by Dunhill (part of BAT British-American Tobacco). With the withdrawal of Dunhill from the tobacco market in 2017, Dunhill sold its brand Charatan to “Tor Imports Ltd.” (based in the UK) in order to save the old tradition brand of Charatan. Today Charatan produces pipe tobacco blends that are inspired by the former Dunhill pipe tobaccos.",
