        "description": "Meridian - balanced, poised and sophisticated. Cyprus latakia is layered with fine Virginia tobaccos and small leaf Orientals, then pressed, sliced and tumbled into ribbons. More savory than sweet, with classic structure, medium body, and captivating complexity, Meridian is the perfect companion for a mid-day stroll or with the afternoon tea.",
        "notes": "Notes:Meridian is the third entry in the Old London Series. A classically styled blend that's wonderful when young, but with a good backbone for longer aging. It's a medium-full mixture, with flavors that evoke memories of some of the great latakia blends from days gone by. Red and orange Virginias are joined by a generous, but not overwhelming measure of Cyprian leaf, for a wonderfully earthy foundation. The spicy/sweet Oriental tobaccos add fullness, and an exquisite aroma. Not as \"big\" or as full as Westminster, but similar in style. An excellent blend for a relaxing afternoon smoke, or as a delightful \"amuse bouche\" before dinner - Meridian was introduced in October, 2010.",
