        "description": "Grandfather\u2019s Own Blend is a great early morning  smoke, after (or with) that first cup of the day,  smoked around the family, friends or around town  because of it\u2019s great room note. This aromatic was  blended for my grandfather 45 years ago and was  among my first blends. It has the taste of exotic  Brazilian Cocoa, with a touch of vanilla and brown  sugar, and it makes this burley and virginia blend  an even balanced and great everyday smoke.",
