        "description": "Coniston has a cult following, and its easy to see why. Consisting of 75% dark fired leaf 12.5% Malawi burley and 12.5% Virginia, this tobacco is strong but very smooth. Without the addition of alcohol and floral extracts, this blend would be woody, smooth and very rich. With the added flavouring, Coniston takes on a wonderful sweet and floral nature. Some detect a slight soapy note, but this is common with all Lakeland blends, and after a few smokes can no longer be detected.",
