        "description": "Sometimes I find it challenging to hit upon an easy category to put a tobacco into, and every now and then they fall in to multiple groups. Our Sugar & Spice is one of those tobaccos; is it a Lakeland, an aromatic or even an Oriental blend?\n\nThe confusion begins with an Oriental Izmir base; this creamy tobacco is more commonly found in latakia blends. A generous helping of American black cavendish is used to give the tobacco a silky smooth, aromatic quality. It is polished off with some gold & mahogany flue cured Virginias to add some slight extra nutty and sweet nuances; topped off with cinnamon, nutmeg and delicate rose topping; making this a truly unique tobacco that has made even the most die hard, anti-aromatic smokers, finish bowl after bowl.",
        "notes": "Notes:Best smoked packed tightly and (exceptionally cool and smooth, if) supped slowly.",
