        "notes": "Notes:As a thank you for their support of the industry, Sutliff gave several content creators the opportunity to introduce their own blends. Each was given discretion over recipe, naming, and art. Sutliff then produced the mixtures as show exclusives, with all profit going to the respective creators. Hunter's Camp Blend is a collaboration with the YTPC channel Pipes, Tobacco, & Whiskey. It was first offered at the 2024 CORPS Richmond Pipe Show, and will continue to be found at pipe shows attended by Sutliff while supplies last.",
