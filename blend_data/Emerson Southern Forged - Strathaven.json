        "description": "A straight Virginia blend containing three Red Virginias, Long Cut Virginia, Lemon Lead Virginia and Stoved Red Virginia. Not sweet but full of flavor. The stoving process helps cool down the tendency of Virginias (with higher natural sugar content) from burning too hot in the mouth.",
        "notes": "Notes:ESF never includes sweetening agents unless they are specifically mentioned as an integral part of the blend or as an option; propylene glycol is not used as a carrier for flavoring agents. The goal at ESF is to provide a custom alternative with consistent, repeatable performance, to the discerning pipe enthusiast. Pressed if requested. We try to create blends that captivate your attention, take time to unravel, and take you on a journey. Custom blend requests are welcome!",
