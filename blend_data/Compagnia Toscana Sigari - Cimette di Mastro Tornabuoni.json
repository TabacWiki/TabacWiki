Produced in the Sansepolcro factory (translated from Italian). \n\nThis tobacco is composed by Tuscan Kentucky from Italian cigars, in fact the word \"cimetta\" meanig the final part of this cigar type. The tobacco appear very dry and friable, the aromas are dominated by wood and peat but also, in minority, leather and earthly; during the smoke is very aggressive and impetuous, full bodied and satisfying.",
