        "notes": "Notes:Punakawan is a unique type of character in Indonesian shadow theatre.They generally represent the commoners.The characters of Punakawan indicate various roles, such as the warrior advisors, the entertainers, social critics, and clowns, a further source of truth and wisdom.In Javanese wayang, the punakawan characters consist of four figures namely Semar, Gareng, Bagong, and Petruk.\n\nAnd about the blends, LOYAL would be the best word to describe this blend. We dedicate this blend of our honoured tobacco lovers to achieve their satisfaction. We focus on latakia as our main ingredient and add some black cavendish to smoothen the flavor. We give a pinch of burley for its body and also a pinch of Virginia for its sweetness. Wrapped by the aroma of citrus, fruit and honey would make a perfect match for relaxing occasions.",
