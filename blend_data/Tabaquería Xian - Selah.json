        "description": "Selah, a moment to pause, reflect, and exalt.  This word appears in various parts of the Old Testament of the Bible, particularly after Psalms of praise.  It tells the reader/singer to take a moment to meditate on what he has just read or sung.    Many pipe smokers read when they smoke, and or many more, the time with their pipe is a chance to get out of the wordly hussle and bustle.   Selah is a reminder to take a moment and relfect on what we are doing.  \nAn English-style mix containing Latakia, burley, Virginia, Turkish, and Cavendish.  Subtle and nuanced, it is a mix made for smokers with palates trained to find hidden flavours and aromas.",
