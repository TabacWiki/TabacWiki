        "description": "For centuries, men of the sea have known the pleaures of fine Virginia tobaccos, pressed and aged with a drop of rum. The addition of rich dark fired Kentucky leaf brings a new dimension to the flavour and aroma of this timeless combination. Chart your course for a new world of enjoyment, light a bowl, and set sail with Navigator.",
        "notes": "Notes:From GL Pease: First, if you're expecting an \"aromatic\" tobacco because of the mention of rum in the description, and an aromatic is what you're seeking for, this ain't that. Second, if you're afraid of tobaccos with a little rum in them, don't be. It's an enhancement, not something overpowering. It brings out the natural fruitiness of the bright and red Virginias that comprise the backbone of the blend, and softens the edges and the earthiness of the dark fired Kentucky a bit. Think of it as a nice, stout and sturdy VA with a little something extra, and you won't be far off.\n\nAs far as strength is concerned, it doesn't warrant a skull and crossbones on the label, like some of the wickedly potent English death rattle flakes, but neither would I consider it a breakfast blend, except for those with iron constitutions. In other words, don't be afraid of it, but treat it with some respect. On the strength-o-meter, I'd say it's a little south of JackKnife Plug, but definitely fuller bodied and more heady than the other VA flakes in my catalogue.",
