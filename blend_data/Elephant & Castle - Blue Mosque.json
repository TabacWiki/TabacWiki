        "notes": "Notes:By the early 1980's there were no longer any fine cut Turkish tobaccos being sold in the USA. Their time had passed, and light Canadian and Danish shag cuts had taken their place. As the unstated mission for Elephant & Castle was to \"fill gaps\" where they were found, it was decided to do a \"Public Service\" by including this tobacco in the range. What we knew about cigarette tobacco was engraved on the head of a pin, but Ken McConnell's knowledge was encyclopedic. Let's face it, you don't become the best by guessing or flipping a coin! He went to work, and came up with a great mixture. By E&C's end in 1989, Blue Mosque was the best seller by quite a margin. Interesting considering that many US dealers didn't even want to carry this one. We created a \"Launch Offer\" for new dealers to specifically insure that they stocked Blue Mosque. As years passed, we began to notice that orders for Blue Mosque came in with regularity. It didn't take long to figure out why. It's a cigarette tobacco, and one 50 gram tin probably lasts a day, while a tin of pipe tobacco may last several. In addition, if a smoker liked the Turkish flavor, he had few, if any other options. Needless to say, we felt pretty smug by the success of our \"Public Service\" tobacco, but let's face it - even a blind squirrel finds a nut from time to time! As with all the tobaccos in the E&C range, \"Blue Mosque\" was hand blended in the McConnell factory.\n\nInformation from \"The E&C Story\" on the Marble Arch Ltd. website: http://www.serjacopo.com/e%26c/E%26C_000.html",
