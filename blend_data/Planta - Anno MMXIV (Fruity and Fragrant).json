        "description": "The 2014 Limited Edition blend from Planta is a sweet and very fruity aromatic. A smooth and creamy blend of double fermented black cavendish with zesty Virginias and cooling white burley. This classic continental mixture is given a sweet topping of Mango and Lychees. The ripe and fruity flavours are matched with a fragrant room note. The high quality and extensive processing makes this one of the finest aromatic tobaccos on the sale at the moment. The use of only natural flavourings and traditional blending techniques makes the annual Planta blends something special. \n\nCut in a beautiful ribbon cut for ease of packing and at the right moisture content for a easy lighting and smoking experience. Anno MMXIV is not a strong tobacco smooth and mellow enough to smoke all day long. A great treat for all the smokers with a sweet tooth and because it's a limited edition and when its gone, it's really gone.",
