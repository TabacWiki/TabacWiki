        "description": "According to master-blender, Christian Pickup, the idea for this blend came to him in the space between waking and sleeping; as he was dozing, the notion arrived in his mind.  The next day he made the blend, and it has been a top-seller for Tabaquer\u00eda Xian ever since.  This rich blend is composed of several different cavendishes, Cyprian Latakia, Oriental, and red Virginia.  It is smooth, gives dense smoke, and is sure to please the palate of the discerning pipe smoker. Many clients of Tabaquer\u00eda Xian have said that the blend reminds them of the Frog Morton tobaccos.",
