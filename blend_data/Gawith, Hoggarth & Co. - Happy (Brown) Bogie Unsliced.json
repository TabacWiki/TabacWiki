        "description": "This is a dark fired and dark air cured twist. Also known as Happy Bogie. An old fashioned rope tobacco that provides a stout smoke with high nicotine content.\n\nAll our twist tobacco varieties are manufactured by the same spinning process using dark fired wrapper leaves. The filler is again, predominantly dark fired leaf with the addition of a small percentage of dark air cured Indian leaf. They are therefore strong tobaccos.",
        "notes": "Notes:This Gawith, Hoggarth & Co. dark fired and dark air cured twist is also known as Happy Bogie. This brown twist is a bit stronger than the black twist and is made to slice into coins for smoking, or small plugs for chewing - as done by many sailors.",
