        "notes": "Notes:This is a new concept of tobacco mixing the traditional Brazillian Rope-cured Tobacco and Virginias from Southwest/South Brazil. At this blend, ARAPIRACA LTDA introduces the use of the Cavendish process on the \"Goiano rope\" (from Middle-west Brazil), which aggregates notes of vanilla in the natural sweetness of the guava-based notes commonly found in this rope.  Also, contain the most famous Brazilian rope, the \"Arapiraca rope\" (from Northeast Brazil), processed in two different manners, which aggregates earthy and floral notes. This blend is rich in well-processed Brazilian Virginias, inviting both the smokers of aromatics and non-aromatics into a complex smoking time that travels it back to the history of the country man.",
