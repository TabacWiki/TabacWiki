        "description": "Joining Warped's selection of pipe tobaccos, Gellis and Reeves present Warped's Until the End as a regular production mixture. The blend's moniker is taken from one of Kyle's high-end wines, with a matching logo inspired by the loyalty of the Cane Corso dog breed that accompanied Roman legionnaires. Like the Napa Valley red, Until the End pipe tobacco is fragrant, comforting, mellow, and rich \u2014 a broken flake boasting a combination of top-grade Sun Grown Ecuadorian cigar leaf, Virginias, the same cigar leaf Cavendish used in Kings Stride, and a specially selected Dark Fired Kentucky grade that's a tad less smoky than normal varieties. Also like the wine blend that shares its name, Until the End delivers deep, robust, and earthy flavors, sure to be a loyal companion from the charring light onward.",
        "notes": "Notes:Known for their boutique, Cuban-style cigars, Warped is curated and supervised by founder Kyle Gellis, an entrepreneur and lover of all things bespoke and luxurious. He has a taste for finery and approaches his ventures with rigorous standards of perfection that are applied to the slightest of subtleties. Such a mindset translated naturally when Warped expanded into pipe tobaccos in 2019, seeing Kyle Gellis collaborate with Cornell & Diehl's Jeremy Reeves to create nuanced blends, marked by quality components and intriguing flavor profiles that align with Warped's \"be exclusively different\" mantra.",
