        "notes": "Notes:Warhorse, last sold in the UK in the early 1980’s, is a robust “everyman’s” pipe tobacco, consisting of earthy, hearty burley, ripe red Virginias, a good share of smoky, spicy dark fired Kentucky and a bit of perique for a hint of sweetness. It has a very light top-note that helps to smooth out the flavor. This is a bold smoke, best enjoyed after a nice meal with a nice libation.\n\nWar Horse was a popular brand of pipe tobacco in Ireland, and it gained a following throughout the UK, as well. It was known for being a stout blend of tobaccos with an earthy, spicy flavor and full body. The War Horse Ready-Cut was made until the thirties but disappeared. The Standard Tobacco Company of Pennsylvania acquired the brand with the intention of bringing it to a new generation of pipe enthusiasts.",
