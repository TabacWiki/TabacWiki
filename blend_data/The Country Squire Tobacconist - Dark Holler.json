        "description": "A fine aromatic blend of Burley, Virginias, Black Cavendish, and Perique.  Choice leaves are blended, carefully pressed into a generous cake, aged, and then hand-rubbed.  Mirkwood is hearty, full, semi-sweet, and kind to the mouth.\n\nNot a gooey, wet aromatic, but a Hobbit Aromatic\u2026 and that means comfort.\n\nMany perilous paths have led you here to the edge of Mirkwood forest. The Old Forest Road is the one you must take. The way is narrow and dark with trees that are tall and menacing all around. The woodsman had told you tales of giant spiders, elves, and an ancient fortress built by a necromancer. Fear could overtake you, but you have prepared for this journey. You take out your pipe from your pack and open your pouch filled with delicious pipeweed. An aroma of baking spice, nutmeg, buttercream, and caramel fills your senses. You light your pipe for the long journey through the forest.  The plumes of sweet smoke bring peace to the air that is thick with enchantment.  Your pipe resounds with notes of vanilla, almond, coconut, and cane sugar. As night befalls you, your senses get keener as you spot cobwebs in the trees and lurking eyes of yellow and red in the thickets. Just like this forest at nightfall, the mixture you puff now takes on darker tones.  Notes of dark chocolate, deep red wine, tangy cherry, anise, and spiced blackberry have come to the forefront of your sense, rounding out the bowl. You have pressed on for many miles and finally spot the end of the Old Forest Road. You look back upon the path you have trod and feel more courageous, yet sad, because the unexpected journey is now closer to an end. Peering once more into your pouch of tobacco, the thought comes to you: \u201cYes! I shall name this fine leaf after the ancient forest I have crossed. Mirkwood is thy name.\u201d",
