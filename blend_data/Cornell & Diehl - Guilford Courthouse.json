        "description": "C&D pays tribute to our heritage with Guilford Courthouse, a new Virginias blend named for the closing battle of the Southern Campaign during the American Revolution. Fought in our home state of North Carolina, we find it fitting to honor this battle that took place in part of what would become known as the tobacco \"Old Belt\" with a blend of the finest Red and Bright Virginias grown in the Old Belt region. And, just like the Revolutionary War soldiers adding a pinch of salt to their stew, we've added a pinch of extraordinary Izmir Oriental leaf for spice and to enhance the sweetness of the Virginias. We trust you'll enjoy this new blend from C&D.",
