        "description": "When winter approaches, many pipe smokers prefer richer blends, and Hearth & Home Slow-Aged First Snow is just such a tobacco. It begins as a broken flake made of robust burley, zesty-sweet Virginias, and a bit of dark-fired Kentucky. The result is a deeply flavored blend that's comfortable and satisfying. Then, the tobaccos are placed into a press and held for a month to develop the flavors and give them a more unified richness. For anyone who enjoys the taste of burley, Hearth & Home Slow-Aged First Snow is a must try.",
