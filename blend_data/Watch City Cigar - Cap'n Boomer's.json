        "description": "In chapter 100 of Moby Dick, Captain Ahab meets Captain Boomer of the British whaling ship \"Samuel Enderby\". Captain Boomer, too, was mauled by the white whale and lost a limb which was replaced by a whale bone, but unlike Ahab, boomer was able to maintain his sanity and put the episode behind him. He is more interested in telling Ahab of all the good rum he drank during his recuperation than the gory details of his amputation. This English-meets-American-blend salutes Cap'n Boomer's love for the demon spirit. Rich crumb cut burley, Carolina and latakia are cased with a measure of Ship's Rum and aged for several weeks under pressure. Delicious!",
