        "description": "A fine composition of choice Virginias with a fully ripe cavendish and Syrian latakia, giving this classical mixture its satisfying taste. Solent is specially manufactured from quality selected tobaccos.",
        "notes": "Notes:Aka \"English Mixture\". As of 04/16/2018, Syrian latakia is still used as a blending component. According to Nick Shane at SmokingPipes.com, the label indicates Syrian latakia is used in this blend, and that Mac Baren's does have some stores of Syrian latakia, but it is unknown for how long.\n\nUpdate: As of 01/30/2019, according to Per Georg Jensen of Mac Baren it has \"Latakia from Cyprus, it is many years since the Latakia from Syria were used.\".\n\nFrom the tin: Solent Mixture was first produced in 1950, making it the oldest brand in the Mac Baren range today. The actual mixture is particularly interesting. Essentially the tobacco consists of sweet Virginia tobaccos mixed with a full bodied burley, to which is added the original Mac Baren cavendish and making this mixture very special, Syrian latakia tobacco. Solent Mixture is a full bodied tobacco with highly distinctive spicy flavour and aroma. A tobacco that harks back to the age of full-rigged ships with the air on board pungent with the smell of salt water, wharfs and tar. An authentic English mixture.",
