        "description": "1960 RG Dun Admirals from a sealed box, chopped;\n2021 White Burley;\n2021 Toasted Burley;\n2015 McClelland X-10 Burley â€” \n\nNamed for the sailors best friend (as long as you don't kill it) this is a blend for the burley boys who love a side of fine literature. When I found a sealed box of RG Dun Admiral cigarillos from the 1960's, I smoked a few while reading \"The Old Man and the Sea\". It gave me inspiration. My gut said, \"Chop them up and blend them with aged pipe tobacco.\" So that's what I did, and the result is this one of a kind blend that no other human on earth will make for you. \n\nAged 2 years after blending",
