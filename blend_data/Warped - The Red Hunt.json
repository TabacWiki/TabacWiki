        "description": "Known for their boutique, Cuban-style cigars, Warped is curated and supervised by founder Kyle Gellis, an entrepreneur and lover of all things bespoke and luxurious. He has a taste for finery and approaches his ventures with rigorous standards of perfection that are applied to the slightest of subtleties. Such a mindset translated naturally when Warped expanded into pipe tobaccos in 2019, seeing Kyle Gellis collaborate with Cornell & Diehl's Jeremy Reeves to create nuanced blends, marked by quality components and intriguing flavor profiles that align with Warped's \"be exclusively different\" mantra.\n\nJoining Warped's selection of pipe tobaccos, Gellis and Reeves present Warped's The Red Hunt as a regular production mixture. It's a vibrant, invigorating combination of Red, Mahogany, and Bright Virginias, alongside aged Basma and Izmir Turkish varietals and finely fermented Perique, and offers a full and commanding complexity. One of the few Warped blends not to showcase cigar leaf, The Red Hunt is perfect for those who desire quality, natural components but don't prefer cigar leaf. Plus, the aging potential of this blend is remarkable. The hunt is over, but the journey has just begun.",
