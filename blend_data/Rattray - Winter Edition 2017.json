        "description": "As the days grow shorter, we begin to yearn for warmth, cosiness and harmony. We are launching the new -Rattray’s Winter Edition 2017- to provide you with the perfect companion for colder days.\n\nThree black nutcrackers adorn the copper coloured tin of this special limited edition tobacco. If you look more closely, you will see that the pipe smoking nutcracker in the middle has a smile on his face whilst his fellow nutcrackers to the left and right bear a serious expression we’re sure that you get the message!\n\nYou would also be right to think that this design also gives a clue about the taste. Nuts are certainly included macadamia nuts to be precise but only enough to allow the sophisticated caramel taste of Crème Catalan to remain in the foreground. All of this is rounded off with a touch of Tahiti vanilla to give a truly delectable overall mix.\n\nThe tobacco components used comprise black cavendish, burley, Virginia and mini-cut (burley).",
