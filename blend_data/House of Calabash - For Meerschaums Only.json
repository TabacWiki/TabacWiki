        "description": "This is an American English style blend to provide something from an era not many tobacconists are aware of.  Before the mid 1800s, English style blends were traditionally made with Virginias, Orientals, and Turkish.  American English blends were made with Virginias, Orientals, and Turkish, along with burley and perique. Latakia was noticeably missing in both of these blends during those early times. England was such a world power on the seas that trade allowed for tremendous variety of tobacco varietals to be used in their mixtures from all over the world. When that began to wane, latakia began to be introduced in England in greater quantities, and by the wealthy almost exclusively.  It was used in the very famous and sought after Balkan Sobranie in the mid 1800s.  It wasn’t until the 1870s that latakia was introduced into the United States. My blend includes latakia but in a small quantities, providing a mixture more closely resembling the early English and American English  style blends. It was originally designed to color  meerschaums either in a coloring bowl or without.  (Don’t worry, if you are a briar smoker it smokes  equally great in your favorite briar). My approach is an American English style blend where there is a small amount of latakia which gives a slightly sharp taste, lightly sweetened with the burleys, Virginias, and perique. It burns very well and is noticeably softer than a full blown English blend. I found it delightful over all these years that my Reserve and Ancient Reserve both reflect that ongoing passion conceived from this original blend.",
