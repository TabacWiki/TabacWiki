        "description": "With Grand Point, there\u2019s a more subdued spiciness, more akin to cinnamon and nutmeg. It also has a fruitiness that comes across as a wine-like note, and there\u2019s a hint of cocoa in the flavor. The spiced wine character is the most noticeable in this blend.  This entry in the Golden Triangle Series comes the closest to what people expect from Perique.",
        "notes": "Notes:The Golden Triangle Series of pipe tobaccos is a showcase for some very rare versions of St. James Perique. Mark Ryan, of L.A. Poche Perique Company decided one year to put up a barrel of Perique from each of the four growing regions of St. James' Golden Triangle, rather than mixing them together for processing. This experiment created four distinctly different versions of Perique. In the Golden Triangle Series, Russ Ouellette has created a base blend that is used in the four regional mixtures that allows you to be able to see the difference in the flavor of the singular Perique varietals. To round out the series, Mark has allowed us to offer a tin of straight St. James Perique (as opposed to the usual Acadian Perique), the first time that pure St. James has been offered to the public in many years.",
