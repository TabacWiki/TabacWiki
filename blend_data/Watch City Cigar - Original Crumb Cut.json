        "description": "Original Crumb Cut is the unadulterated burley we use as a base for all of our \"Crumb Cut Burley\" blends. If you've smoked \"Stubb's Pipe\", \"Deluxe Crumb Cut\", \"Quint's Own\" or \"Cap'n Boomer's\" then you've been introduced to this fine burley to a degree already.\n\nO.C.C. Is not always available, as we use it extensively in our blends, but from time to time we will make it available when we have an excess. It's a wonderfully cool, sweet burley cased and cured via traditional methods with no top-note added. Just burley... great straight or as a base for your own blends!",
