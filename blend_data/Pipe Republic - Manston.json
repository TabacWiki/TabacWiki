        "description": "Manston, in the far southeast of Kent, is home to Manston International Airport. This airfield was the first landing option British aircraft had in World War II after crossing the Channel. Aircraft very badly damaged by shelling often arrived there with their last ounce of strength. The airmen were relieved to have ground under their feet again and very often reached for the whistle.\n\nIt is not impossible that there was tobacco like this in it. A hot-pressed, spicy Burley flake, loosely rubbed on and left to mature for a few more weeks. The result is a gently spicy, slightly dark chocolate scented \"tobacco cake\" that will delight friends of dark aromatics. Clean burn, no artificial flavoring. Rather light to medium-bodied.\n\nNo frills, down to earth tobacco.\n\nA wonderfully honest Broken Flake in the English style.",
