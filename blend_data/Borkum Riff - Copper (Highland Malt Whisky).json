        "notes": "Notes:Known in the US as \"Highland Malt Whisky\". The name was changed in Europe to \"Copper\" due to EU regulations.\n\n---------\n\nOriginally known in Gaelic as 'usquebaugh', 'water of life', 'aqua vitae' or whisky, as it becomes known, was first distilled in Fife by Friar John Cor during the 15th Century. Drawing from its rich heritage, Borkum Riff Highland Malt Whisky is a robust, full-bodied but mellow, naturally subtle blend of Virginia and burley tobacco flavoured with a fine mature malt from the Scottish Highlands.",
