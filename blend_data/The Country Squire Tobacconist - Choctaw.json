        "notes": "Notes:Choctaw was originally Cherokee #1.  About 20 years ago, Cherokee #2 was rebranded \"Cherokee\" and Cherokee #1 was renamed \"Choctaw\".  There was a Cherokee #3, but a key blending ingredient for that tobacco was discontinued.  Cherokee and Choctaw are very similar, but smokers tend to think of Choctaw as stronger due to the different Virginia tobaccos and proportions.",
