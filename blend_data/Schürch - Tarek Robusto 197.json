        "description": "Hans made this mixture, with Tarek in mind back in 1994; at that time, Tarek smoked exclusively English with Latakia. Since then, the mixture has always been marketed with the name you see above. Now, the pouch aroma reveals the sweetness of the VAs, the smokiness of the Latakia, and the oiliness of the Orientals used. Upon lighting we find the tobacco to be very \"creamy\" and smooth on the palate and a bit spicy in the nose, without being harsh or aggressive; later a taste of \"muddy\" soil comes through and it is wonderfully complementary to the rest of the tastes present. Gradually you get to realize how complex this mixture is: There is a host of distinct tastes that are never in conflict with each other. This is a great instance of a mixture that allows you to enjoy its wholeness, without losing site of the taste and aroma of its individual ingredient tobaccos. At the end, a slight taste of \"lime\" develops, and it is a nice way to round off the myriad of tastes enjoyed in the course of the smoke. Combustion is very regular and slow. This is an ideal mixture for moments of relaxation and contemplation.",
