Earl said \"I have had about ten bowls of this in different pipes, so here is my first thoughts on it. I liked the first bowl I smoked of it, it can stand pat as is and is a very good blend. However, it is not right on for me as an all day blend yet\". 50% of two Burleys, 30% Red & Lemon Virginia, and lesser amounts of both Perique and Latakia.",
