        "notes": "Notes:From Pipes&Cigars website, written by Russ Ouellette:  About five or six years ago, I was asked to create a limited run blend for some friends. I wanted it to be something special, so I made a Latakia blend with a twist: the Turkish Orientals were gently toasted to change the flavor profile. We called it Fireworks, and people really enjoyed it, but we had to stop production because the toasting process took too much time. In honor of our nation's independence, we're re-releasing this hearty latakia blend, but as with the original, it will be available for a limited time, so if you enjoy it, you'd better stock up.",
