        "description": "From Victory Pipes website, Canada:\n100% unique to the Canadian market and until now, exclusive to Quebec. This exotic delight was created by Cornell & Diehl and features a specially aged 2011 oriental tobacco from Macedonia that adds a unique character to the tangy red Virginia base. It\u2019s a blend that transports you to the heart of the Orient. Only limited quantities remain \u2013 once they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone. Plain Packaged in 50g tins.",
        "notes": "Notes:This is a pleasant tobacco, with a cut between ribbon and shag.  The pleasant tin aroma reminds me of McConnells Turkish cigarette tobacco (long gone and no longer available), probably due to its oriental content, and the usual fruity Virginia that is in it.  I smoked this in a small pipe, a large pipe and even rolled it in to a cigarette.  Gradually, the strength creeps up behind you and you get what I think is a mega-dose of Vitamin N.  However, it is a most pleasant smoke and reminds me of some of the old, no longer available oriental-leaning blends from when I was just a young pipester; Four Square Red or Green, to name one of these blends, as well as the McConnell Turkish Cigarette tobacco taht I alluded to, earlier.\n\nAvailable only in Canada, while supplies last.",
