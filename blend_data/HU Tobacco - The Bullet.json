        "description": "This is a medium strong pleasant spicy ready rubbed flake from dark red Virginia, mixed with a pinch of perique and a hint of Havana and Brazil tobacco. The pronounced malty and discreetly tart sweetness of red Virginia is wonderfully supported by the spicy tobaccos and great rounded. We have added a new, specially developed flavor as a topping to this mixture. The result is a pleasantly spicy and at the same time subtly fruity sourish blend, whose iridescent taste always provides tension without being uneasy. If you like great natural tobaccos and are not averse to an enigmatic topping, who wants to get involved in a taste adventure and always has the tobacco qualities in mind, you should try this tobacco.",
