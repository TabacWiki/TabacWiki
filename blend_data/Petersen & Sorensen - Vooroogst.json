        "description": "The famous tobacco growing area of the Dutch East India Company has been Lumadjang to this day. The leaf of these tobaccos is so beautiful that it is still being used as cigar wrapper. They are light in colour, and in cut form are of great \"light-handedness.\" The traditional name is \"Voorogst.\" Vooroogst is a delicacy manufactured to the old Dutch recipe, that is being deliberately offered without any additional flavourings in order to preserve the unique tobacco flavour.",
