        "description": "Handblended, premium pressed Virginia flake pipe tobaccos.  A fine vintage, naturally sweet, in limited quantity. The 2013  blend is made with a special selection of orange, flue-cured  Virginia from the 2009 crop near Rocky Mount, North Carolina.  Picked at the peak ripeness, high in natural sugars, rich in oils, intense in color, this is a marvelous leaf that should age with distinction.",
        "notes": "Notes:Released at the 2013 IPCPR trade show.\n\nAdditional material from McClelland: We present this 2013 Christmas blend in partially broken flakes so the smoker can rub them out to suit any occasion.  Savor the flavor as it develops throughout the smoke.\n\nEach buying season, we search for tobaccos that possess superior quality and distinctive character.  In various combinations, their flavors, aromas, and textures contribute to overall excellence in our entire pipe tobacco product line.  The leaves of different crops and regions are blended to maintain consistency from year to year.\n\nWith Christmas Cheer, we treat our discriminating customers to the singular pleasure of a tasting of the very finest in tobaccos of a particular vintage, not worrying about maintaining the flavor and appearance of future generations of this product but actually striving instead to capture the unique character of a single crop and area.\n\nThat's what Christmas Cheer is all about.  Happy Sampling!",
