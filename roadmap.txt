Core Project Goals
Bring the Tabac Wiki back online and ensure its long-term stability and accessibility for the community.

Remain an independent, community-driven resource, free from corporate interests and control.

New User-Facing Features
A suite of new features has been promised to expand the wiki's functionality:

User Accounts: A login system for users to have a personalized experience.

Blend Rating System: The ability for users to rate tobacco blends, complete with a personal rating history.

Cellar Cataloguer: A tool for users to log and manage their personal tobacco collection.

Tobacco Diary: A feature for users to keep personal journals and notes on their tobacco journey.

Interactive Data Graphs: New ways for users to visualize and explore the blend database.

User Blend Submissions: A feature allowing community members to add new blends to the database, which are currently added manually by you.

Database & Content Overhauls
Significant improvements to the core data of the wiki have been promised:

Complete Blend Description Revamp: An overhaul of over 8,000 blend descriptions. The plan is to replace subjective or corporate-supplied blurbs with accurate, consensus-based descriptions.

This will be accomplished by using local AI models to process and analyze existing community reviews to generate the new descriptions.

Image Overhaul: An update to the blend images, using real pictures sourced from the internet or uploaded by users.

Database Update: A general database update to include all the latest blend releases and bring the wiki's information back up to date.

Fixes & Maintenance
Ongoing Maintenance & Updates: General commitment to maintain the site and keep it running smoothly.

Domain Fee Coverage: A promise that a portion of the funds raised will cover the website's domain fees for at least another year.

Contributor Recognition:

All supporters will be permanently acknowledged on a special Contributors Page.

You will contact each contributor to confirm their preferred display name (real name, nickname, or anonymous).

Beta Access for Contributors: An additional reward for supporters will be giving them access to 'beta test' new features before they are rolled out to the public.
